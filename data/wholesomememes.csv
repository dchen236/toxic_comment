Apparently my grandmother took our mom away when she was 2, and he didn't know where his daughter was for 14 years.

Obviously its not a 100% return rate but you‚Äôd be surprised at how many people will text you first and invite you to things if you just make an effort keep in touch with them.

It‚Äôs a nice surprise		t5_3gcwj	I was in a similar boat a while ago, ask her. I let it eat at me for years and eventually some other guy with a lesbian haircut took her. I did eventually tell her to get that weight off my back and that didn't really do much. However, about 4 months later I met the most amazing girl I've ever met. Very white, dark brown hair, and those kind of eyes that are green towards the outside of the irises and gradually become blue in the middle. We agree on just about everything with only a few differences, but hey if we agreed on everything it'd get a little boring. After knowing her for a month and a half I stsrted dating her, never been happier. Haven't even thought about my crush on the first girl until I read this thread, even though we're still good friends. Don't wait man, you're the motherfucking CanadianScotsman. Get that shit over with. If it doesn't work out then fuck it, wasn't going anywhere anyway and if it does then you're a happy man. Good luck on your endeavors and have a good day.	36	1589988343.0	/r/wholesomememes/comments/gn9wyl/its_a_nice_surprise/fr8y132/	3

Very strong indeed!		t5_3gcwj	"If you aren't able to communicate with honesty and you don't want to share your thoughts, desires, and dreams, then you're weak. You don't need to tell everyone everything, but if you're withholding crucial information due to insecurities and fear, then you're hurting everyone.

In order for us to heal our world, it's important for us to stop being afraid. If others react to you ""opening up"" by shunning you and being mean, then two things could be occurring: They're insecure and unaware that their actions are destructive, and/or you're expressing yourself in a cringey way that is self-centered.

It's our responsibility to find better ways of communicating, and when some people make fun of us and don't acknowledge us with respect, we can continue to share with others and realize that we don't need to be controlled by others. Irrational fear is an illusion, and it's time for us to stop being afraid and start loving each other."	2	1590008807.0	/r/wholesomememes/comments/gnawi1/very_strong_indeed/fra500f/	0
