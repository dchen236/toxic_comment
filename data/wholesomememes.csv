He was so happy that we both reached out, it made him so happy he couldn't stop talking about his joy from us reaching out to him. Apparently my grandmother took our mom away when she was 2, and he didn't know where his daughter was for 14 years. He could never connect with anyone in his family after that, and just spent the last few decades waiting for someone to reach out to him. So sad to think about, but I'm so happy that we have finally been able to connect!"	8	1589989998	/r/wholesomememes/comments/gn9wyl/its_a_nice_surprise/fr91del/	1

He was gone for months and there were times when I thought I wasn‚Äôt gonna year from him again. Then I ended up going through a really bad breakup. It sucked, and I felt miserable for the entire day. I ended up getting a text from him the next day, where he caught me up and asked me how I was doing and everything. It was incredibly sweet of him, and it made me feel a whole lot better.	6	1589998011	/r/wholesomememes/comments/gn9wyl/its_a_nice_surprise/fr9i5nv/	0

10849	It‚Äôs a nice surprise		t5_3gcwj	I've found that people will start reaching out to you if you reach out to them first. The honest truth is that people tend to stop thinking about people who aren‚Äôt involved in their lives, but if you reach out to them you'll be on their radar and they‚Äôll hopefully start reaching out to you. Obviously its not a 100% return rate but you‚Äôd be surprised at how many people will text you first and invite you to things if you just make an effort keep in touch with them. Someone has to make the first move why not you? I think the amount of work that goes into maintaining friendships with people you don‚Äôt see on a daily basis is really understated.	3	1589997821	/r/wholesomememes/comments/gn9wyl/its_a_nice_surprise/fr9hrpt/	1

10876	It‚Äôs a nice surprise		t5_3gcwj	I was in a similar boat a while ago, ask her. I let it eat at me for years and eventually some other guy with a lesbian haircut took her. I did eventually tell her to get that weight off my back and that didn't really do much. However, about 4 months later I met the most amazing girl I've ever met. Very white, dark brown hair, and those kind of eyes that are green towards the outside of the irises and gradually become blue in the middle. We agree on just about everything with only a few differences, but hey if we agreed on everything it'd get a little boring. After knowing her for a month and a half I stsrted dating her, never been happier. Haven't even thought about my crush on the first girl until I read this thread, even though we're still good friends. Don't wait man, you're the motherfucking CanadianScotsman. Get that shit over with. If it doesn't work out then fuck it, wasn't going anywhere anyway and if it does then you're a happy man.

If u open up you're stronger and u got over your feelings, if u don't open up u still haven't, getting over some feelings, it's very tough so don't knock yourself over for that	13	1589984942	/r/wholesomememes/comments/gnawi1/very_strong_indeed/fr8ri3z/	3
10957	Very strong indeed!		t5_3gcwj	"If you aren't able to communicate with honesty and you don't want to share your thoughts, desires, and dreams, then you're weak. You don't need to tell everyone everything, but if you're withholding crucial information due to insecurities and fear, then you're hurting everyone.

In order for us to heal our world, it's important for us to stop being afraid. If others react to you ""opening up"" by shunning you and being mean, then two things could be occurring: They're insecure and unaware that their actions are destructive, and/or you're expressing yourself in a cringey way that is self-centered.

It's our responsibility to find better ways of communicating, and when some people make fun of us and don't acknowledge us with respect, we can continue to share with others and realize that we don't need to be controlled by others. Irrational fear is an illusion, and it's time for us to stop being afraid and start loving each other."	2	1590008807	/r/wholesomememes/comments/gnawi1/very_strong_indeed/fra500f/	0
