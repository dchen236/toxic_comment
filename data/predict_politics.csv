Yet the campaign cannot withhold funding to a state as retaliation for going against their  ballot initiatives   Trump  however  can do that  illegal as it may be  as president  and therefore he is the direct person to ask about what exactly is illegal about the Michigan SOS s decision

  So today  Pres Trump  who regularly votes by mail  threatened to hold up federal funds for two battleground states  Michigan   Nevada   bc they are trying to make it easier   safer to vote during the coronavirus pandemic 

    Then  
 PressSec
 referred Qs about it to Trump campaign   

https   twitter com kaitlancollins status 1263196166503702532

  The White House has repeatedly declined to say what it is the president thinks happening in Michigan that is illegal    Instead referred those questions to the campaign   

That s SHS level deflection"
6598,"Well I m late  but I ll just sum this up because I ve got nothing better to do  Here are the  highlights  for today 

  McEnany opened by praising Trump for fulfilling his promises to bring back American manufacturing jobs  in relation to PPE   rebuking Obama s comment that you d need a  magic wand  to bring them back  She did not give any job numbers to back this up 

  Every time McEnany was asked about what made pushes for mass mail in ballots illegal  as Trump claimed in a tweet  she said to direct questions regarding that to the Trump  campaign   her former employer 

  When a CNN reporter asked about why Trump doesn t support mass mail in voting  McEnany said there has to be a  reason  for doing it  When the same reporter said the virus was a good reason to have it  McEnany snarked  I m glad you have the prediction tool to know what will be happening November 3rd   When the reporter brought up primaries coming up soon  McEnany deferred to the Trump campaign again 

  When a reporter asked about Trump s claim that  thousands of people  on the front line of combating the virus are taking hydroxycloroquin  this launched McEnany into a list of prepared statements  including defending the original use of the drug  listing talk show hosts who mocked Trump for claiming he was using it  Jimmy Kimmel  Jow Scarborough  and Chris Cuomo   bringing up that Chris Cuomo used a more  unsafe  version of the drug  and quoting NY Governor  Andrew  Cuomo about his hopes for the drug  that were made before revelations about it  

  McEnany defended Trump s complaint about Michigan s mail in voting by saying it was directed at the Office of Management and Budget  rather than his base  When a reporter asked why Trump would voice that complaint in the form of a tweet instead of a statement  that doesn t mention the OMB  McEnany said it was a sign of  unprecedented transparency  in the Trump presidency 

  Regarding Trump s comment that the high number of cases was a  badge of honor  for the country  McEnany clarified that it was an indication of how many tests the country has that there were so many known positive cases 

  When a reporter quoted Eric Trump saying that the coronavirus will  magically go away  after the election  implying it s being exacerbated by the Democrats  McEnany said she hoped Trump and his family wouldn t be taken out of context  despite being a direct quote  and that  we should all hope the coronavirus goes away   seemingly ignoring the context of Eric s quote herself 

  When asked about Michigan Governor Whitmer asking why she wasn t invited to an event with the president in her state  McEnany listed the money and resources her state was given  saying  the governor is concerned about an invitation when she should be thanking the president 

  When asked about an op ed from Susan Rice about Trump s response to the virus  McEnany briefly summed up a timeline of Trump s response to the virus  glossing over the month of February  before focusing on an email Rice sent herself about the Flynn investigation and criticized her career  She then said  Thank you for bringing up Susan Rice  not in the context that I wished  but thank you  before leaving "

   We recognize ‎that your governing coalition faces not only endemic corruption left from decades of mismanagement and cronyism  but also an illegal armed seizure of territory by Russia and its proxies   the senators wrote   Tackling such obstacles to reforms amidst a war and the loss of much of southeastern Ukraine s economic productivity is a formidable challenge    one which we remain committed to helping you overcome  

  Full text of the letter can be found below 

   Dear President Poroshenko 

   As members of the U S  Senate Ukraine Caucus and strong supporters of your government  we write to express our concern regarding the recent resignation of Minister of Economy Aivaras Abromavi ius‎ and his allegations of persistent corruption in the Ukrainian political system 

   During the past year  Mr  Abromavi ius and his team implemented tough but necessary economic reforms  worked to combat endemic corruption  and promoted more openness and transparency in government  He was known to many of us as a respected reformer and supporter of the Ukrainian cause  Minister Abromavi ius‎ s allegations raise concerns about the enormous challenges that remain in your efforts to reform the corrupt system you inherited 

   We recognize ‎that your governing coalition faces not only endemic corruption left from decades of mismanagement and cronyism  but also an illegal armed seizure of territory by Russia and its proxies  Tackling such obstacles to reforms amidst a war and the loss of much of southeastern Ukraine s economic productivity is a formidable challenge    one which we remain committed to helping you overcome 

   Succeeding in these reforms will show Russian President Vladimir Putin that an independent  transparent  and democratic Ukraine can and will succeed  It also offers a stark alternative to the authoritarianism and oligarchic cronyism prevalent in Russia  As such  we respectfully ask that you address the serious concerns raised by Minister Abromavi ius‎  We similarly urge you to press ahead with urgent reforms to the Prosecutor General s office and judiciary  The unanimous adoption by the Cabinet of Ministers of the Basic Principles and Action Plan is a good step 

   We very much appreciate your leadership and commitment to reform since the Ukrainian people demonstrated their resolve on the Maidan two years ago  and we look forward to continued cooperation in the future"

I think it is great that we could all work together to get rid of the TRAP laws this year  I volunteer at a clinic in Richmond  you should stop by some Saturday morning next session  but I have had to curtail due to social distancing  But clients going into the clinics face harassment disguised as  counseling   that borders on terrorism  We have been lucky but I am pretty sure that the craziness with the other protests is going to be reflected at the clinics once the state reopens fully  Is there something that could be done statewide to provide either buffer zones or just something to back up local law enforcement so clients can obtain a medical procedure without having people in their face all of the time  I think the police actually know that some of the protestors routinely break the law but don t want to deal with the churches crying to the media about it    


Anyway  thanks again and keep up the great work

And we are relatively lucky  with stable jobs  rich lives  and a very strong support system  There are so many of us out there who have it so much worse  This will be a huge help to all of us

Now being in the 21st century  all of the information in the world can be readily accessed from a device in our pocket   do you think Covid will push our education system into a more Remote based system  thus making it far more available to the average person  

When I got my license to prospect health insurance   I was given a link and told to learn everything on the website  by myself  and take a test in a few weeks  It was simple  yet hard   and relatively cheap  Certain subjects  would  still require professors  but I feel like slowly moving education to a remote based system would greatly improve the scholastic Marks across the country

7203,The General Assembly is not currently in session  but that s definitely something we can look into when we get called back for a special session 
7204,After seeing the machine of politics up close and personal  I agree with you   There are limitations to the authority of state and local government  but the powers they have over housing policy  healthcare policy  and labor laws are immense   And the barrier to entry is much lower   Congress is the big flashy thing that everyone wants  but state and local governments are where you need to be to really change things up

Democrats have got to have a concrete plan to help people make ends meet   Especially now  during what looks to be another Great Depression that we re stepping into   And they ve got to have the added credibility of not taking corporate money for their campaigns  because all the promises in the world don t mean anything if people think you ve already been bought out "

7215,"Virginia is proof of how gerrymandering fails   It seems impenetrable for a long time  but what the party in power does is they pack a bunch of the other party s voters into a small handful of districts  so that they can draw a lot of districts that lean somewhat in their own favor 

So what we saw in VA was the Democrats going from 34 100 seats in the House to 49 100 in 2017   Then up to 55 100 in 2019   That s because the shift in voter participation caused all of those Republican gerrymandered districts to fail at once 

So don t lose heart now   This year s legislative elections in almost every state will decide who draws the maps for the legislature AND Congress for the next 10 years   You ve got to keep pushing at it  but once you get over the breaking point the gerrymander will fail all at once and that s when chambers change hands "

As for the question of a third party  I really think that the first past the post ballot system precludes that as a possibility   Too much of the electorate is afraid that if they vote for a third party they actually like  that the major party they hate will end up winning more seats   If the country were to switch to a ranked choice or approval type ballot  then that might change the calculation  but that s how I see things as they are now "

Socialism  on the other hand  is a system where the people who do the work actually own their workplaces and make all the decisions in them   Because when the workers are the ones making the decisions  there are certain things they ll just never do   They won t outsource their own jobs to increase a profit margin   They won t poison their own community because they re the ones breathing that air and drinking that water   And when times are tough  they re much more likely to have everyone tighten their belts a little bit rather than just laying off thousands of people to pay big bonuses for the CEOs "

7234,"I think the Democratic Party desperately needs an agricultural policy that s different from what big agribusiness pushes   Because right now  the main difference between Dem agricultural policy and Rep agricultural policy is that there are fewer environmental regulations to comply with when the Republicans are in charge   No wonder the Dems can t convince anyone that they re good for farmers 

This is something that I ve thought a lot about  but haven t put into legislation yet   I m thinking something along the lines of a certification for cooperatively owned and family owned farms in Virginia  that qualify their products for a retail subsidy would be incredibly helpful   Combine that with universal healthcare and massive investment in helping municipal governments and rural electric coops build out broadband infrastructure  and you ve got a set of policies that gives rural voters a real reason to vote for you

With the economic crisis in the wake of COVID 19  which looks like it ll be on par with  or worse than  the Great Depression  now s the perfect time to put people directly back to work  rebuilding our energy infrastructure in a way that s compatible with still having a planet to live on when we re older "

If you don t have people from all walks of life in a legislature  you end up with policies that leave people behind because of unnecessary hurdles and means testing 

Every legislative body has a team of attorneys on staff to help make sure that the intent of the legislators is correctly translated into legal ese  and beyond that it s up to the voters to decide whether or not the individual candidate has a firm grasp on the actual issues that matter in the race 

The 2017 elections really began a change away from that narrow subset of people in the General Assembly  when I got elected along with some reporters and a social worker and a nurse practitioner  and a bunch of other folks from more varied walks of life   That diversity of experience has already paid dividends for the people of Virginia  and I believe it will continue to do so "

Everyone acknowledges that corporate money in politics is bad  but so many elected officials are dependent on these donations to fund elections  The party is in a Catch 22  true power lies in eschewing Corp money  but eschewing Corp money means a bunch of Democrats would lose the ability to campaign "

You are exactly the sort of candidate we need more of today "

 with the pay

7329,"it is hard to strike a balance  

thank you for everything you ve done for virginia  if you ran for governor or the senate i d definitely help out with the campaign "

7331,Thank you 
7332,"Awesome thank you  They are clearly slot machines and games of chance  The bars cut for even having them in their establishment doesn t seem worth it  At least give the small business owners a majority of the revenue  

Follow up question 
Are you working on any bills with Denver Riggleman on funding to prove the existence of Bigfoot   Facetiously speaking "
7333,Sick  Thanks for the response  man o7
7334,That s a good idea to look outside my district too  thanks   
7335,Thanks for the clarification
7336,Thanks for fighting and stepping up in politics as a member of our generation  I ve gone back and forth on getting in  I was very involved in university  but went the corporate route to earn money to support my fam  I think I ll start by joining a campaign to help organize 
7337,Morals aren t objective  so no  morally acceptable and socially acceptable refer to exactly the same concept  Well  mostly  They differ slightly but not in the way you described  Something might be considered socially acceptable due to tradition  whereas morals are based solely on what is thought of as good or bad 
7338,"Thank you for not actually answering what was a tough  but fair question by explaining the virtue in electing public officials with no relevant education or experience  

The people of Virgina didn t vote for a  team of attorneys who speak legalese   Lee   They voted for you  and I think that they have a right know that their elected official s  are qualified  or not  Frankly  I think the Commonwealth can do better "
7339,I m sure that the homeless have plenty of good ideas about how to improve housing and vagrancy laws  That doesn t mean that we should elect a homeless person with no relevant education or experience to administrate HUD 
7340,"I understand that is currently a member of the Virginia state legislature  

My question is why should I vote for support a person  member or no  who is vastly underqualified for their position  

I think it s irresponsible and disrespectful to the people of the Commonwealth that Lee would even run for office 

We need to demand better "
7341,I  ve made no claim that  being a politician is a profession and you need a law degree   Neither do I think asking that our elected officials meet a minimum standard of qualification is unreasonable or  elitist  
7342,"Well  I d like to see that candidates for public office have the discipline to have first completed an undergraduate degree at the very least  

I also wouldn t vote for a person that hadn t made some effort to learn more about public policy and the law specifically  For instance  interning with their local Congressperson  Mayor s office  or law office 

Elected officials should be required to have demonstrated those abilities that qualify them as public servants through education and personal experience  I think that s both reasonable and fair "
7343,"It s neither  reactionary  nor  counter revolutionary  to require that our elected officials first demonstrate their qualifications to hold public office  regardless of their political affiliations  I ll leave you with this 

 Does it follow that I reject all authority  Perish the thought  In the matter of boots  I defer to the authority of the bootmaker  concerning houses  canals  or railroads  I consult the architect or the engineer For such special knowledge I apply to such a  savant   But I allow neither the bootmaker nor the architect nor the  savant  to impose his authority on me

7344,"That is simply not true  Here is the definition of socialism  courtesy of Merriam Webster    https   www merriam webster com dictionary socialism  https   www merriam webster com dictionary socialism  

    1    any of various economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods    
   
   2a    a system of society or group living in which there is no private property  
   
   b    a system or condition of society in which the means of production are owned and controlled by the state  
   
    3    a stage of society in Marxist theory transitional between  capitalism  https   www merriam webster com dictionary capitalism  and  communism  https   www merriam webster com dictionary communism  and distinguished by unequal distribution of goods and pay according to work done 

Based on our Constitution  socialism has no place in this country  However  I am appreciative of Carter s openness and hope he responds to this topic "
7345,"It really depends   Some legislators are on committees  boards  and commissions that meet outside of the legislative session   I m on the House Committee on Finance  for example  and we have quarterly meetings to discuss the Commonwealth s revenue collection and budget priorities 

We also have a small staff  which spends most of their time outside of the session helping people navigate issues with various government agencies   My office has been busy helping people follow up on unemployment claims for the last few weeks 

But in general  most of the General Assembly just goes back to their day job and runs their re election campaigns outside of the legislative session "
7346,Jay Jones and Lee Carter voted to raise the gas tax in Virginia    10 over the next two years and indexed to inflation thereafter  They promote saving money with a cap on insulin while charging every Virginian more for gas  Like putting a little money in one pocket and pick pocketing you at the same time  Have a great night 
7347,Gas taxes are regressive and takes a higher percentage of lower incomes than of higher incomes  Lee is boasting about saving people money with the capped insulin copay  while taking money from them in the form of a gas tax

7349,"How about yes 

If the goal is to unite people for progressive ends  then drop the self satisfying ideologies and build a wider coalition 

If the goal is to feel like a badass and an outsider  then proceed the current course  I guess "
7350,I think it s mostly that politicians don t see a problem being cozy with big business   They ll say that a donation would never change their vote  and they re usually right  because they re the types of people who would just vote for those awful corporate policies anyway   It s almost never envelopes of cash under the table  but a system that depends on big business for fundraising  which selects the kinds of candidates that big business would want to fund 
7351,"That s only a little bit worse than the disparity Virginia had after its 2015 election   It s an uphill fight  to be sure  but you have to overpower the current map at the right time to make sure the same people don t draw the next one 

And now is that time "
7352,Chomsky always gives long answers about tactical voting and whether you re in a safe seat or a swing state 
7353,Bernie  Chomsky  and AOC are entitled to their opinion but are not infallible nor do they fully represent the political left in this country  Personally  I think they all have capitulated and cowered from doing their best in face of power  So no  I won t be doing what they say because they say so 
7354,"When liberals listen to Chomsky on media control of the nation I ll listen to him on tactical votes  

Fair trade "
7355,It s almost like Chomsky and Sanders can do things that we disagree with
7356,And those figures are welcome to their opinions  A means tested student debt relief program and reducing the medcaid age by 5 years just isn t enough for me  And so far  those are the only  overtures  he s made to the left 
7357,Thank you for your follow up as well 
7358,IDK if that s a disingenuous take or an innocent regurgitation of a disingenuous take  but what Bernie said was  I believe that it s irresponsible for anybody to say   Well  I disagree with Joe Biden    I disagree with Joe Biden     and therefore I m not going to be involved   
7359,"They should make their choice  based on the two candidates 

I keep hearing talk that Joe needs to take on Bernie s policies to earn their vote  but I have yet to hear one of them say that Bernie should would do the same for the moderates in the party   He even said he should be the nominee without the majority  and would nominate a progressive 

Joe has done a hell of a lot more in compromising  and trying to bring the party together than anyone gives him credit for   Make your decision on voting  but don t tank the vote  and the country because someone doesn t go far enough   If you re ideas are great  then get a candidate out there who can bring everyone together  and inspire us with those ideas  and that wasn t Bernie  he s too divisive "
7360,"  You can choose a continuation of open corruption and increasing authoritarianism  or you can choose a platform of progressive democracy and a return to functional government and independent justice 

I need to be convinced of this by Joe Biden  So far I m not "
7361,The absolute radio silence from the Unity Police when Biden puts out  something like this  https   imgur com QjfOzSb  or says  stuff like this  https   www nytimes com 2020 05 19 us politics joe biden israel anti semitism html  is pretty illuminating 
7362,Name one Biden policy
7363,Did you miss the part about vote shaming 
7364," We are not in a moment where we have the luxury of ideological expression or  protest voting  

Except we are  How rock bottom do we have to get before people open up to progressive candidates  I intend to find out "
7365,TO people like you  it s grovel  not unite  You have no interest in uniting with people like me 
7366,"I agree with them that in this election cycle is it irresponsible not to vote  However I do understand where progressives come from on the perspective of not feeling like they have a voice  I believe it is an issue of their own making however by going for the head and trying to give everyone this ah ha moment that progressive policies are the way to go  It should be bottom up to build their base and support if they want to gain traction imo 

A person s vote is one of the most powerful things someone possesses in a republic even if sometimes people don t feel that way in the scope of national elections  I do believe withholding your vote is 110  fulfilling your civic duty while simply not voting isn t  if that makes sense  In the same way on a smaller scale votes are courted in congressional dealings by giving concessions to a home district or state  

Take the news reports of people in the villages turning against Trump in local polls  progressives may not like it and yell same side but courting them is 100  the logical thing to do  they are net gains as former Trump voters and say what you want about them  they are still votes for Biden that will show up by the 4 seater golf cart load to vote in a swing state  This is where purity tests kill a lot of progressives imo "
7367,"I absolutely do see them as a vehicle for transforming our economy to be more fair and just   Now that they re a legally recognized type of business  we can start adding them to the list of business types that are eligible for economic development incentives and government contracts 

The largest cooperative in the world is Mondragon  which has around 90 000 worker owners   We can replicate that success here  but it ll take a legislative framework that makes it possible  and hard work from people willing to build it from the ground up "
7368,"IDK what kind of answer you are expecting here  He is against money in politics and also thinks the entire system is corrupt  


You seem to be under the impression he is some sort of ideological progressive democrat working within the constrains of the party when in reality he is a non buzzword socialist who is working within the constrains of the terrible political system in order to enact actual change on a local level "
7369,That went from zero to 100 real quick

7372,"But  Dread Pirate    he actually DID answer your question  Fully  actually  Now  you can ignore that fact and beat the drum of  only lawyers can be politicians  or you can understand that the hugest office has no standard you are trying to enforce  

Honestly  your question was actually a  gotcha  question if you look at the surface of it  So  with that said  what do YOU expect to have for an elected official duly appointed by the people and for the people "
7373,lol ok run then chief
7374,He answered your question 
7375,"  The people of Virgina didn t vote for a  team of attorneys who speak legalese   Lee  They voted for you  and I think that they have a right know that their elected official s  are qualified  or not  Frankly  I think the Commonwealth can do better 

Didn t his constituents decide he was qualified by voting for him  Either you re one of them  in which case I m sorry that you were outvoted  though you re welcome to run against him or campaign for his opponent    or you re not one of them  in which case they clearly don t give a shit what you think "
7376,"He actually gave you a better answer than you deserve  For a  socialist  you have an embarrassingly telling obsession with gatekeeping positions of power to being only available to the wealthy 

Not that it matters  upper class politicians have failed America time and time again  and have shown what an utterly idiotic idea classist gatekeeping of power behind vague notions of  experience  and superfluous degrees that cost more than most can afford "
7377,You re entitled to your incorrect opinion
7378,If their officials aren t qualified  why did they vote for him 
7379,I would elect an unhoused person in a  heartbeat  over some Ivy League educated rich dude who was going to campaign on his experience and education and then fuck us all over in office 
7380,"  I think it s irresponsible and disrespectful to the people of the Commonwealth that Lee would even run for office 

He won  and is currently serving in the state legislature  so apparently his constituents disagree with you "
7381,Good for you  But really  drop this  we  rhetoric  Nobody cares  People voted for him  so clearly they felt he was qualified enough  and that s all that matters  Your personal views on what qualifies a candidate are completely irrelevant  And considering he is currently in office  I would think he has been gaining experience in the process 
7382,That is incredibly classiest He won an election where he met every requirement to run  If anything we need more working class folks in office over doctors  lawyers and businesspeople 
7383,Then how about instead of attacking Carter you be more detailed about the qualifications and explain how they should be equally achievable by poor and rich alike 
7384,Do you support free college 
7385,I mean  state assembly is basically an entry level position  The bar should be relatively low for positions like that  Higher offices can be more demanding of relevant experience 
7386,The qualification is that they have the correct ideology and win  But let me know when some useless anarchist wins political office 
7387,Appealing to dictionary definitions for incredibly complicated topics is usually not a good idea  People have spent over a hundred years writing millions of pages about what exactly  socialism  is  as an ideology or an economic system  You shouldn t go to a couple sentences in a dictionary to explain how  actually  the person you re talking to doesn t believe in the things they believe in 
7388,Your first def there says worker ownership of means of production 
7389," Based on our Constitution  socialism has no place in this country 

And  One of the most fundamental aspects of the Constitution is that it can be changed "
7390,Thank you so much for the answer  That was informative

 Give up your divisive beliefs and instead believe what I want you to believe  

Disgusting "
7394,"This has been tried by calling people  Progressives   Turns out  Progressive doesn t mean anything  anyone can call themselves a progressive for clout and then not follow through on anything that anyone would consider leftist in any way 

Not really seeing a point in unifying people who do and people who don t want mass exploitation of the politically powerless "
7395,Being a socialist requires rejecting the established power structure  It s a good thing to know who will define themselves thusly because the people who won t will most likely bend to the establishment when things get tough 
7396,Fair enough  that makes sense  Although I do feel some people are more cynical and know there is a pay day waiting in the private sector if they play ball 
7397,Honestly that s something I ve been thinking about a lot recently  It doesn t have to be  politicians are being bribed by big business  when the only people able to become politicians often  cause of shit like funding struggles  are the ones who are favorable to those larger companies on their own 
7398,"This is an amazing  incisive comment about the way bad ideas can look more sinister than they are  That we would feel better with grand conspiracy instead of a blind  idiot system built on selfishness and inertia 

Thank you for being an ally in the struggle "
7399,Like the money you ve indirectly taken from Sean Parker  a billionaire  Parker is one of the biggest donors to the Democratic Party in Virginia  and the party is one of your biggest donors  I believe all donations are fine but don t act like you don t take money from billionaires  The big money goes to both parties and funnels to campaigns including yours 
7400,True and Chomsky also says participating in this way isn t much of an attempt at true democracy given that we live in a plutocracy  He suggest spend 5 minutes voting then go back to building the movement  Everyone always leaves out building the movement part 
7401, Chomsky and Halle s essay on lesser evil voting  https   chomsky info an eight point brief for lev lesser evil voting   is essential reading for any leftist liberal thinking of voting third party in a swing state 
7402,His entire platform is moving this country to the left from what we currently have 
7403,"  shrug 

No one really expects anything from the Chapos beyond regressive shit posting  So don t sweat it 

If you do decide to have an interest in the policies  they are there to be seen  and  other  progressive leaders  including your former hero Bernie  are fully on board 

We are not going to waste time here wringing our hands over the  support  of people who don t demonstrate any honest interest in the goals at hand  Do what you will "
7404,"What 

Free college tuition for everyone making under  125k 

One example of progressive policy approaches  

What is the point of this question "
7405,"I m not interested in anyone s goddamn  feelings  right now  We are dealing with a multi level crisis that the country as you know it may never bounce back from 

Either do the right thing  or don t 

No one is going to beg and no one is going to hold your hand  The decision should be obvious for any rational  concerned  decent person  Put the egos away  let go of the primary  quit it with the  isms  and save your country while you still have the option "
7406,"And this is exactly why we don t bother to court your votes  

It s fucking pointless and a waste of time "
7407," Fuck the loss of lives and liberties   I want to see my ideology succeed  

Yeah no 

There is literally nothing  progressive  about that point of view 

You re not being the hero in that situation  you re literally just helping fascism tighten its grip  And that s not an exaggeration 

The current democratic platform   is progressive    Biden has the support of progressive leaders   not just out of necessity  but because things like the Green New Deal and free college are being represented 

Again   this is a lot more about ego and divisiveness at this point than it is true progressive movement  much less saving democracy from actual tyranny 

No one can control how you approach this moment  but the urgency can not be denied  The idea that we can burn it all down and see what happens is privileged  childish  and possibly sociopathic "
7408,There s nothing to suggest that reaching rock bottom will make left leaning ideas more popular or that they will be championed by more competent candidates 
7409,"No  we are not responsible for what you choose to do  You re presumably an adult and you can make your own choices  and own them 

We have an outright authoritarian government on one hand  and we have a progressive democratic platform on the other 

There is just no rational argument to be made  Either do the bare minimum to preserve some future for this country  or don t  But don t try to deflect the blame on everyone else for  your  action or inaction  

That s a Trump move  son "
7410,"Mondragon is a lackluster model though  as it includes non worker owners and it undermines itself that way 

One of the biggest hurdles faced by cooperatives is financing though  You re not going to get help from the usual business incubators because there s nothing in it for them  Cooperative or local public banking with a pro worker agenda would really help  Do you think that s something that can be developed upon "
7411,"I was looking for any single straightforward answer to a question I asked about our political system  which he is a part of  not the run of the mill bullshit where you use a lot of words but say nothing at all  

Not too much to ask I would think  regardless of political ideology   Anyone acting as a state representative should be able to actually articulate their opinion on the matter I raised  

And by the way  a great way to increase the support and movement for a third party like socialism would be to very directly and openly speak on the issues that I asked about as there are millions of people who feel abandoned by both main political parties and are looking to find someone they can get behind  as long as the person can vocalize what the believe in  the problems that they see and how they would like to fix our broken system  

But sure  I m the problem for actually expecting an elected official to directly answer questions that are  now in this political environment  more prevalent and important than ever "
7412,"Simply calling you out for not actually answering a single question I asked or expressing any kind of definitive stance  

I am honestly just pretty disappointed that someone who says the endorse many of the same ideologies as I do is unwilling or unable to express their stance on some of the most important problems within the system that they work "
7413,No don t tell him to run  he might get elected   
7414,If there s no minimum standard  how then are we able to evaluate whether a candidate is qualified

That you disagree with my opinion is irrelevant "

In fact if we had  more   establishment  right now  we might have had a more responsible and effective response to the pandemic  Or you know  constitutional oversight and functional justice systems   The system  is not the problem  the problem is the fuckers who break it for their own benefit 

I find the entire mindset and rhetoric of the  anti establishment Left  to be shallow and useless  The real work is being done by people who are unifying  crafting policies  exposing corruption and fascism  If you guys really want to do something positive here  you d be helping  instead of doubling down on a  Left vs center  dichotomy that is frankly largely artificial and self serving "

How many NYT pieces did we see about Centrists colluding to stop Sanders  About Centrists risking party damage by stealing the nom from Sanders at a brokered convention  

If anything this primary should make it very clear that the leadership in control of the party  the donors of the party  and all the consultants and hanger ons will never let a progressive win the nomination  

The corporate Democrats would have rather see the party completely broken than let Sanders win  Why would you try negotiating with the very same people that tell you  You ll never have real power   By falling in line you are rewarding that behavior 

There s a sizeable enough chunk of voters that went Sanders that could throw the election either way  That s real political power  The only way to win against corporate Dems is through leverage  it s all they understand  When will Progressives start to actually throw their weight around  

There s historical precedent for it  too  Young Republicans that went ape shit for Barry Goldwater significantly shifted the party the right  ushering in decades of conservative domination  

Corporate Democrats are counting on the left to suck it up  for the moralizing to work  but fuck that noise  I won t be moralized to by people who enable corporate Democrats  a wing of the party that is not interested in improving the quality of life of it s citizens "

7443,They shouldn t need a third party  Lee s staff  to navigate an agency like the Virginia Employment Commission  If the agency and it s process were intuitive and effective people wouldn t need the extra help  Don t stereotype boomers on setting up phones   a derogatory generalization 
7444,Nobody said people don t need support for Apple products  The difference is that when I contact Apple for support with a product  I don t need a third party to help navigate the support with Apple  Based on the comment Lee made about his staff helping constituents navigate support with agencies in Virginia  that s an example of needing a third party to help navigate that government agency  I applaud his team for providing the assistance  The larger opportunity is to expect better service and efficiency from government agencies  thus eliminating the need for third party help to get support from the agency that should deliver that support 
7445,Democratic platform for 2020  Support for AIPAC  Maintaining the War on Drugs  Support for KSA  support of for profit healthcare  drone strikes and endless wars  no prison labor reform    Sounds like a whole lot of nothing to me
7446,"Of course you find it shallow and useless because you fundamentally misunderstand the  establishment  premise on which it is founded  The establishment is not some shadowy cabal making orders from behind a curtain  It s regular people employing subterfuge  sabotage  and violence to promote and maintain status quo systems of exploitation for the benefit of them and their co conspirators  The establishment is everyone involved with selling the Iraq War lie to the American people  The establishment is everyone involved with selling lies about the efficacy and savings Medicare for All would create  The establishment are the ones who made sure the covid stimulus mostly went to the wealthy and the establishment are the ones doing insider trading 

The establishment is NOT Batman villains sitting in a lair plotting on how to conquer the world  Get a grip "
7447,"I don t entirely disagree but I would argue the system is absolutely the problem  or at least what the system has become  Did you know 2 3 of congressmembers were millionaires before they were in congress  And they got into congress by taking corporate money  and when they re done they ll go into private industry so they have to make sure they do right by business while they re serving  with the interest of the people serving as a secondary motivation  You can look up how much public opinion reflects legislation that gets passed  very little  and how much the desires of the top 1  reflects legislation that gets passed  almost all of it   When push comes to shove the capitalists in power in congress will always side with the capitalists in charge of the economy 

I understand your feeling because I ve seen people on the left who want to cancel AOC because of stuff she says sometimes  which I think is absolutely absurd when you look at the real stuff she fights for every day  But you have to draw the line somewhere  why should I be on board with what Nancy Pelosi is doing as she draws from the same Democrat playbook of offering very little materially  means tested tax credits  for example  while trying to appear like she s standing up to Trump even though she s supporting expanded border security and military budgets  and giving no support to actual inspirational progressive policies like the Green New Deal  We need to demand much better from congresspeople and the best way to ensure that is to support candidates who don t take corporate money and actually want to change the world for the better  people whose goals happen to align with those of socialists "
7448,"I don t agree with the view that voting for Biden would be  rewarding the behavior  of the party  It should be about expected policy outcomes first and foremost  In our current system there are two viable candidates for president  The one that is closer to progressive values is Biden  That doesn t mean he s progressive  it doesn t mean that he s a good candidate  and it doesn t mean that he s above criticism  It simply means that  between the two  he s the better choice  

If you care about marginalized people and communities  it would make sense to want to lessen the harm done to them  I think it s inarguable that another four years of Trump would be more harmful to them than four years of Biden   For me  that s what it comes down to  If I was in a swing state I would vote for him without hesitation and immediately go back to putting pressure on him and the Democratic party 

I think the issue that a lot of people have  and that you re touching on  is a very real one that shouldn t be ignored  Corrupt and disgusting behavior by establishment Democrats and their apparatchiks should be highlighted and discussed  A lot of them want people to ignore it and pretend that it doesn t exist  which is ridiculous and intellectually dishonest  I just don t think that the logical conclusion is to abandon electoral politics or vote third party in a swing state  especially when it will result in the constituencies  poor and working people  not only here but around the world  that we care about being negatively affected more than they would under a Biden presidency "

People had an option  and they chose not to go with M4A   If people wanted it so desperately  then Bernie would have won out 

Joe has made the GND part of his platform   His plans are not as aggressive as Bernie  a more moderate proposal implemented now is better than a more aggressive one implemented in 4 10 30 years down the line   

Sure I would have loved to have a candidate with a more aggressive climate proposal  but the rest of Bernie s candidacy pretty much killed that as an option

I also wouldn t vote for a person that hadn t made some effort to learn more about public policy and the law specifically  For instance  interning with their local Congressperson  Mayor s office  or law office

Drone strikes are not a cut and dry topic and they never were  and  endless war  is a hollow phrase that ignores the complexity of the Middle East and of geopolitical challenges that we share with allies

 If you care about marginalized people and communities  it would make sense to want to lessen the harm done to them 

You think Biden and co give two fucks about this  Biden created the systems that he now talks about dismantling  These people believe in absolutely nothing except victory  and you re allowing them to lead you around by your sense of morality 

You posit this scenario as if I m in charge of policy   I just vote  I don t have power  so trying this moralizing thing is just silly  I didn t build those cages   Biden and Obama did  

I m sorry but all this is talk about lesser evil is a waste of time  The only thing that matters in politics is power and leverage  that s all Biden and co understand  The party will never let you in unless you break it or force it to adapt through leverage  You won t influence them by falling in line  the sooner you accept it the better

7464,"That s not at all what I said  and I m not sure why you ve read it like that

7468,"I hope you re right but neither of those people are close to the leaders we need for such a task 

The New Deal is an instructive example  FDR was openly going directly against the interests of the business elites  who openly despised him in turn  Biden and Pelosi on the other hand try to make everyone happy by catering to business and public interests  but only the public so much as the business interests allow  You can look at Biden s record to see him actively fighting for business elites at every opportunity  

I m not saying at this point he s beyond pointing in a direction that will help people but we still need to demand better candidates than this "
7469,"  Biden said he would veto M4A 

While I don t trust him to actually fight for M4A   his answer was a bit more specific than that  https   www cnbc com 2020 03 10 biden says he wouldd veto medicare for all as coronavirus focuses attention on health html  

   I would veto anything that delays providing the security and the certainty of health care being available now   Biden responded   If they got that through in by some miracle or there s an epiphany that occurred and some miracle occurred that said   OK  it s passed   then you got to look at the cost  

  Biden added   I want to know  how did they find  35 trillion  What is that doing  Is it going to significantly raise taxes on the middle class  which it will  What s going to happen  

 nbsp 

  You posit this scenario as if I m in charge of policy   I just vote  I don t have power  so trying this moralizing thing is just silly  I didn t build those cages   Biden and Obama did 

Voting is a powerful tool because it decides who will be put in a position to enact policy  Because our current system provides two viable candidates in a presidential election  voting should be viewed through the prism of which of the two is more closely aligned to your preferred policies 

  I m sorry but all this is talk about lesser evil is a waste of time  The only thing that matters in politics is power and leverage  that s all Biden and co understand  The party will never let you in unless you break it or force it to adapt through leverage  You won t influence them by falling in line  the sooner you accept it the better 

  Voting third party in a large enough block and loudly decrying these people is the only way they will pay attention 

As Chomsky and Halle explain in the first two points at the end of the essay 

  1  Voting should not be viewed as a form of personal self expression or moral judgement directed in retaliation towards major party candidates who fail to reflect our values  or of a corrupt system designed to limit choices to those acceptable to corporate elites 

  2  The exclusive consequence of the act of voting in 2016 will be  if in a contested  swing state   to marginally increase or decrease the chance of one of the major party candidates winning 

I should ask  do you care about improving the plight of poor and working people not just stateside  but worldwide  If you do  then I m not sure how you can justify a third party vote that would marginally increase the chances of Trump winning  Again  it s inarguable that his policies would be more harmful to those people than Biden s  Framing it as  sticking it to the Democratic party  doesn t change that

7492,"Here s a brief lesson in tells 

While there are some generally accurate tells  the most reliable tell is when someone says or does that s distinctly out of the ordinary for their behavior 

She s set a very clear and consistent behavior of checking her binder full of answers to cover a wide variety of questions  It s clear she s just an emotionless robot designed to spew Trump s bullshit  Whenever she s asked a question the first thing she does is flip to the page of talking points because she never has to actually think on her feet  On one hand you could argue that s being prepared  Another angle it comes off as inauthentic and highlighting that she doesn t actually know any of the talking points until she reads them 

When she was asked what specifically was illegal she didn t have an answer  She didn t have a talking point  Because there isn t one 

She deflected which was a very common feature of Sarah Sanders  She was deflection incarnate  Kayleigh has otherwise been the opposite    straight up has the talking point  Except not for this 

Trump doesn t have an answer for this because it s bogus  Sensible people know it s a bogus claim that it s illegal to have mail in ballots  There s not even a faint indication of a talking point  and that s all driven by how Kayleigh reacts to a question being asked  So whether it s this very obvious lie or another more subtle one  keep this in mind  If she doesn t check her binder and goes off the fly she has no fucking clue and also that Trump has no follow up

Elections officials in most states do analyses to try and find anomalies  and they will have to be extra vigilant whenever there s even more mail in ballots

For example  the Clean Air Act allows the fed to withhold federal highway money if a state fails to implement it s approved State Implementation Plan  And even then  there are a bunch of thresholds that the state must fail to meet before the fed can do it  


Here  withholding funds for reasons outside of the statutory mandate granting is violative of Administrative Law in general as well as the President s constitutional mandate to uphold the law  Even with an excuse of say wartime powers  there d have to be a pretty good reason to withhold funds or else the action would be Arbitrary and Capricious "

7760,Trump and the RNC have raised nearly  500M last year and  300M this year  They have massive amount of cash to burn 
7761,It s cute you think they even need to click the ad for the tracking 
7762,"I also received from my mother  but now people can vote twice  Vote in person then send in a mail in ballot   Two things wrong here 

First  we can t vote in person at the moment  and likely won t be able to by the time the election rolls around  love our hate our state gov  they are doing things mostly right during this pandemic  

Second  No you fucking can t vote twice  Try it  Please try it mother  I don t want to see her in prison for voter fraud  but it would teach her a lesson "
7763,I know  Makes it super easy  No wonder Donnie hates it 
7764,You re right  but the trouble is  they don t care 
7765,The difference is Trump is white  well  spray tan orange  and Obama is black  There have been two sets of laws in this country for hundreds of years 
7766,Yes that s exactly how authoritarians operate  They want the law to protect their in group  and simultaneously punish all out groups 
7767,That s because they are fascists  It s the core element of fascism that the law is about who you are  not what you do   Everything Trump does is legal because he is a born wealthy white man  Everything Obama does is illegal because he is a black man born into poverty 
7768,hey  you get the fuck on outta here with your critical thinking and logic and shit 
7769," These slow witted morons watching Fox News can t even see the hypocrisy even when the two things are presented back to back 

It s almost as if they don t care that they are hypocrites "
7770,Sounds about white
7771,The more intelligent ones are arguing that the President can t be investigated or sued  while he is President   which would make Obama fair game  Also  they have no intention of giving up the presidency 
7772,But Obama was Black   See it makes sense   s
7773,I haven t given it the time of day to look into whatever this new excuse is  but what is  Obamagate  
7774,"I mean  they re also telling the courts that all oversight needs to be through congress and the courts have no jurisdiction over the administration  having already told congress and senate that they have no oversight over the administration and everything has to go through the courts during the impeachment trial 

Their only stance is saying whatever sounds good at the moment "
7775,They don t think it s hypocrisy because many don t think Obama was a legal president because born in Kenya blah blah where s the birth certificate blah  Therefore he s actually not allowed to have broken the leg as president  They don t view him as a legal president 
7776,Oh they know theyre hypocites  They just dont care 
7777,I think you ve delved a little too far  It s more like  when black man does it  it s bad  when white man does it  it s good  
7778,Critical thinking is not part of their playbook 
7779,It is almost an  if I go down you go down  moment  because if Trump is going to be taken down for crimes committed  during  his Presidency than Obama should also be taken down for    well we don t what  but he should be taken down   Problem is  Trump hasn t just committed crimes  during  his Presidency   My hopes are in limbo  but apparently my state has a list of crimes they are just waiting to act on when he is out of office   Obama doesn t have a lifetime of criminal behavior  unless you ask the Q crowd 
7780,Their bad faith argument is that Obama did illegal things as President  but what Trump is doing is legal because he s the President   It s an argument that can only be understood if you re a hypocritical  bootlicking  Regressive moron 
7781,"I honestly think obamagate will be Trump s biggest gaffe  He is going to set a precedent that current presidents can legally go after former presidents for any action they think is illegal  regardless of it s actual legality  Setting himself up for a doozy of a post presidency  

Hopefully  I mean  the motherfucker will probably win in November and be  untouchable  again  But one can dream "
7782,"They got you  Although you are absolutely right 

The point was never about being logical or right  The point was to steer the conversation and hide all the other bs happening in parallel  At this point we should be used to this  but we still keep talking about what he wants  be it Obagamate or Hydroxycloroquine  

This is the only thing they know how to do efficiently and effectively  We should be ignoring them and asking how is it safe to reopen this early  for example  and don t give them a break until they answer  

Enough is enough "
7783,"I would ve been waiting for the explanation of  MORE equal  

  When you re accustomed to privilege  equality feels like oppression   "
7784,Well  it s probably linked to the fact that the Trump campaign is hiring thousands of people to  monitor  polling stations and challenge  suspicious  voters  In other words  voter intimidation  Which isn t as easy to pull off when people vote by mail 
7785,Because mail in ballots are  by their very nature  made of paper and therefore difficult to hack 
7786,I think it s being done under the expectation that he ll lose the election  and Trump will just call it fraud 
7787,"  Is it just more effort to de legitimize the results  

Yep  Ammo for rejecting the results of a fair election that removes Trump "
7788,It s because of the exact reasons you mentioned  it s something they can t  control   They love older dedicated Republican voters going  in person  to the polls because they re dependable votes  Throwing in the option to vote by mail makes that demographic not as dependable anymore  Same thing with African American voters  They can control polling stations and limit the ability of African Americans from typically voting Democrat  Having access to do so by mail limits their ability to control the vote counts 
7789,Those are just reasons why it might be an advantage to dems  but current evidence shows that mail in voting causes an equal increase in voting for both sides 
7790,"I m not sure factory workers vote blue  Not the majority anyway  And my polling station is basically open from morning until night    it s near impossible not to have the time to vote  

And since the pandemic started I think we all know we can just take the fucking day off as a country and go vote "
7791,Joe Rogan says he prefers Trump over Biden so I think it gives better perspective why he d think it was a good takedown 
7792,Joe rogan is conservative who pretends to not be and isn t half as smart as he thinks he is 
7793,Why does that say  even  Joe Rogan  That guy has always been a dumbass and a piece of shit  this isn t surprising in the least 
7794,Joe Rogan is a fucking idiot and anyone that takes anything he says about politics with anything but an absolute eye roll is a fucking moron 
7795,Have you listened to one of his circumcision rants  Dude acts like it s common for babies to die while being circumcised  He s similar to Trump in many ways 
7796,She has a Harvard law degree    Wow  Ok  Didn t see that coming 
7797," Nah  I ll just lie for shit tons of cash

This is what most Harvard law grads are doing  just not in front of a bunch of reporters "
7798,I m pretty sure that s fairly standard  all world leaders have a lot going on and press secretaries can t be familiar with all of it off the top of their head
7799,Yes  which was part of the issue 
7800,I ll give you the answer if you give me gold 
7801,Grab  em by the pussy 
7802,Squid pro row 
7803,Blackmail 
7804,I m sure Trump can t read your thoughtful legal argument  Nor does he care   He will simply withhold funds and tell Michigan to sue him   It s worked all his life 
7805,Trump s entire MO is to find something incredibly unethical  be told he can t do it  do it anyway  and then say   What are you gonna do about it  
7806,And when he withholds funds  what happens  We impeach him again  It would take months and the republicans would refuse to convict anyway would constantly lying to the media 
7807,I agree with your username 
7808,Hate to invoke her name but SHS used to do the same  tell reporters to ask Trump campaign instead of her   Proves McEnemy is no better 
7809,Remember when she said  I will never lie to you  at the press 
7810,She chose to work for her mob boss  criminal Trump   She s cashing his checks   I don t have a lot of empathy for her    
7811,Only these fucking morons can keep backing themselves into a corner in an Oval Office 
7812,Is she though  She spouted her nonsense  then they all moved on and didn t challenge her  Seems she s doing an excellent job 
7813,It s what happens when your boss is a lying sociopath   Dammed no matter what she says
7814,She won t be around for long  I can t stand Sarah Huckabee Sanders but she sure towed the company line  I know they said she left for her own political aspirations but I never hear about her anymore  I wonder what happened there 
7815,I give her about 3 weeks 
7816,She was so used to being spammed all over CNN where she dodged questions like the Matrix until the hosts time was up   Rinse and repeat   Now she refers ppl to the campaign  the campaign refers to the WH  RINSE WITH SHIT AND REPEAT
7817,She knew what she signed up for 
7818," Because I m allowed to 

Wow"
7819,also known as  punting 
7820," Fuckin figure it out 

Please for the love of god can we get Shoresy into a press conference "
7821,There s nothing for them to figure out though  they know it s bullshit  but they have to pretend like it is a real thing because that is what the Toddler King demands of them  Since there is no actual real answer giving a non answer is the best of the bad options available to them 
7822,They have it figured out  They know that they can dodge the question  the press will move on to the next question  and by the time we get to the evening news this won t even be a story because something else absurd will have happened 
7823,Reporters need to press  pun sorta intended  on this and not let up    But this came directly from  the President  while inside the White House  not his campaign  how does  the White House  justify calling the ballots  illegal   
7824,It would also be an official act of the president if he were to retaliate   which absolutely requires an explanation and has nothing to do with nominee Trump 
7825,i think by deferring to campaign it s somewhat of an admission it s bullshit and isn t policy 
7826,He is an impeached president 
7827,He s been campaigning since day one   Never stopped long enough to actually lead because  1  He s incapable of leading  and  2  He just likes the adulation of his sheeple 
7828,Nah be real  The FOIA request is rejected for being  baseless 
7829,A Harvard educated attorney 
7830,It probably has something to do with Trump needing to be the smartest person in the room  Think about the stupid things Trump has said and done  and apply that logic to the statement 
7831,Thanks for that  On May 9th he complained about voting booths  saying it should be mail in only  Hmmm
7832,Wow this is gold
7833,Holy fuck he deletes as much as he posts  What are the odds he also doesn t know how to copy and paste  It s even more astounding with all his typos he keeps 
7834,The original tweet didn t have  applications  in it 
7835,Aryan Barbie pops her gum and then says    Well  it s   like  BAAAD   yah know    then giggles  
7836,"Hypothetically  just 10 different inks or traces could encode 1024 unique ballots  15 would be 32 768  20   1 048 576  you get the idea 

Oh  and this could be massively simplified if instead of just requiring ink anywhere on the page  you put the ink in specific orders  Just 4 inks in 4 different places on the ballot could uniquely address 65 536 ballots  5 inks in 5 places would be 33 554 432 and California s population is only around 40 million "
7837,That guy s Twitter is a great resource  He posts video clips of Trump  with commentary  minutes after it airs live 
7838,Join his mailing list  You ll get these every day 
7839," In a way  the world view of the Party imposed itself most successfully on people incapable of understanding it  They could be made to accept the most flagrant violations of reality  because they never fully grasped the enormity of what was demanded of them  and were not sufficiently interested in public events to notice what was happening  
       1984   George Orwell"
7840,Hypocrisy is the party platform at this point  How does anyone think it s a  gotcha  or even a revelation anymore   They flaunt it  Anyone who continues to allow Republicans to argue in bad faith is a threat to Democracy  aka  all of our media and elected politicians short of AOC and Sanders  
7841,I m actually starting to think that it s less about not caring and more about being racist and dumb 
7842,You re absolutely right  His voters ain t THAT dumb  they know he is awfull  they have sane ideas about Covid  They just see someone like them running the country  I have no panacea a for Trump  other than do not be impressed by him  his image is worthless  he is a conman  We all know that  Fuck him 
7843, The Wire has a quote for just about anything   https   youtu be 409Pjtq7jzY 
7844,Orange is the new black 
7845,since the literal origin of the country  it s baked into the constitution  3 5ths 
7846,Finally  we were all saying it  But you re the only one thinking it 
7847,No one knows  because the Trump administration won t tell you anything about it other than it s the political crime of the century and the most heinous thing in the history of the Oval Office   If you ask them what charges they expect to file you get nonsense and deflection because they have no evidence of any actual wrong doing 
7848,"When Trump was asked  he said it s all out there on every news outlet  you just have to read the news 

In other words he s hoping to let his base use their imagination  It s like in horror novels when they never describe the monster  just tell you how horrifying it is and let your imagination fill in the rest 

This way not only can nobody call Trump a liar because he never gave a specific claim  but his base can believe it is whatever they want to believe it is  One person can believe they ve finally found his Kenyan birth certificate while another can believe they ve finally uncovered all the evidence of his  illegal wiretapping   even though Trump allegedly had all the proof of that his first month in office  but conveniently refused to release it  "
7849,"I was just like   what do you think EQUAL means    

 Well yeah uh I misspoke  but they want MORE equality  

Dumb ass  We didn t last much longer after that conversation  I found out his opinion on Trans folk   "
7850,Good point   People worried about being harassed at polling stations may choose to vote by mail to avoid it 
7851,Have you heard of disappearing ink  That is part of Obamagate  That is how Biden and Bill Gates are going to steal this election and give us chinavirus  9  I am not worried  I have my ginenquinine and NH3 to keep me safe    s
7852,He s also seemingly on board with  Obamagate  
7853,Joe Rogan has peaked  His glory days are over  Now he just goes where the money is 
7854,Good reason to switch from Spotify to Apple Music
7855,Well he a super rich  out of touch  conspiracy theorists who is super into hunting and fishing  His major fan base is white 20 40 y o males  Who mistake having the most basic understanding of a concept with insight and expertise 
7856,Joe Rogan is a fucking moron and he needs to go away  I m sick of even seeing his god damn name
7857,Joe Rogan s an idiot who thinks we ve never been to the moon  I don t know why he s so popular 
7858,Sometimes I think I m going insane listening to him lay out all the dots and then completely whiff on connecting them  His coronavirus rants are a prime example of this  The other day he said the choice between the economy and life is a false one  that we need to be testing and isolating because the virus is incredibly devastating if left unchecked   and then in the same breath criticizes governors for closing before a plan was in place to reopen  Makes me want to rip my hair out
7859,Came here to say exactly this   Even  Rogan  Who gives a shit what he has to say about it  nobody was holding their breath waiting to see where he stood before making their own minds up  Certainly no here wants his political insight 
7860,"Why do all these evil fucking people spouting obvious bullshit have these Ivy League degrees  I have no idea how you could to to a college like that and then go on to lie your ass off in front of the entire US about easily verifiable things  All because you decided to work for a lying dipshit who has no idea what he s doing and spends all day screaming on Twitter

Edit  thanks for all the replies about how ivy leagues are not as important as they re made out to be"
7861,"Reporter  Can you clarify this extremely ambiguous thing president trump has said 

Kayleigh   Flip flip flip   Yeah what he meant was  insert bullshit lie    This is how you address a nation right  By pointing to each word as you read it from a massive binder in a monotone voice and then have your voice slightly change to a self righteous tone just as you see the end of the sentence coming along  Fuckin nailed it 

Reporter  And can you clarify why the president suggested the possibility of injecting disinfectant 

Kayleigh  It s not in this here bible  Who knows  it might work  We can t know  It s actually impossible to know  but he s the president  Ask him "

Every year that goes by  that book becomes more unsettling "
7885,Reading this gave me chills  It truly is spot on describing Republicans today 
7886,They stole a Supreme Cout seat from Obama using a bs excuse  Now McConnell says he ll do the exact opposite if given the chance  They know they re the minority now   are going all in on every slimy trick they can scheme up  That s why there s such a push to appoint judges   undermine democracy  They know their time is running out unless they cheat

7921,He s a very good commentator for the UFC  That s his strong suit 
7922,His peak was NewsRadio 
7923,Spotify just gave Rogan  100mm to spew his bullshit  I won t support any trump loving business
7924,You still have to submit papers and shit I would assume right  Grades are still based on work submitted not just  hand professor 10k   That would be easily found out I feel
7925,Ivy League is exactly what we all thought it was  This is not the first generation to realize rich private schools are full of rich assholes 
7926,It s just status Quo
7927,Dont forget Alt Facts Spicer 
7928,So that s  what   One 
7929,Ppl don t realize this but those loyal to Trump are treated like rock stars as long as they stay within their safe spaces full of MAGA mouth breathers   Plus as long as there is Fox  and CNN which constantly allows liars to obfuscate on TV for the sake of being  impartial   she ll have no problems finding a job   So not surprised there s a new chump ready to step up to bat 
7930,She could also say fuck this  and bounce   but she hasn t   and that tells me she is totally OK with repeating what she knows are lies to the public 
7931,It s okay that some of us want to heed warnings  It doesn t help everyone s psyche but some of us need the truth thrown in our face once in awhile
7932,It s a position for life  He would have to be impeached  It s better if we get the super majority and immediately add five new seats to the court  That ll be the biggest win because we can then put five liberals on the court and proceed with rebuilding our broken democracy and flushing out the corrupt
7933,Yep thats the one  Couldn t put his name out there 
7934,I think if we re being fair that Reddit had a hard on for him after his interview with Bernie  which is by all accounts pretty great  He really gave Bernie a platform to say the things he wanted to say without the bullshit of MSNBC moderators 
7935,"I ve actually shown Rogan s episode with Dr  Cornel West   who is a leftist black professor author activist  he was also one of Bernie s co chairs   to a conservative leaning buddy of mine  And he actually really vibed with a lot of the conversation they had about freedom of speech and comedy 

The guy you replied to is right  his connections with alt right youtube are very real  and something to be concerned of and aware about  But I also think he does represent an opportunity to de radicalize parts of his audience  When his episode with Bernie was first out  the comments section on youtube was so positive  I was so shocked I took some screenshots that  I ll upload here  https   imgur com gallery 34u75cN  

https   www youtube com watch v ViWvAnvT17c   this is that episode with Dr  West  it s a really fascinating conversation to listen to if you re interested "
7936,He s like Trump in that he has the opinions of whoever he last spoke with 
7937,The alt right loves to hype Bernie because it gives them a way to attack mainstream Democrats that progressives eat up despite it being in bad faith 
7938,So  not a moment of clarity then 
7939,"I mean I know Joe smokes  but how high do you have to be to find that white supremacist support asshat funny  Crowder is the literal definition of I m a white supremacist and protofascist bullshit but I hide it all behind  jokes  

I had a friend who I found out like Crowder a lot  Like bought his merch and everything  When I asked him why he supported him and did he know of Crowder guests like Gavin mcinnes and stephan Molyneux who actively spout white supremacist nonsense  and his only response was I just find him funny  It got into a political discourse and I begin to learn he simply has feel into the YouTube right wing rabbit hole  Starting with channels like JRE and devolving into Jordan Peterson  Ben Shapiro  and Stephen Crowder 

I went down that rabbit hole to but I never felt their politics applied to me  If anything it made me reach out and find left wing podcasts like Parkman and majority report "
7940,Don t think he knows either 
7941,"Truer words were never spoken  It s funny because he essentially played the same character he became  I m sure he influenced the writers like Andy Dick did  but he s no longer in on the joke  

Also didn t hurt the cast he was surrounded was one of the best ensembles in sitcom history "
7942,Honestly his best 
7943,Ah thank you for the info  Ya  as I said in another comment  I m pretty sure Rogan will side with whoever pays now 
7944,Saying that Spotify loves Trump because of their deal with Rogan is a serious stretch 
7945,With the right tutors helping prepare you  your notes  conduct research  aid you in completing assigned work  drilling you for interviews or oral examination  it wouldn t be hard really   You don t have to cheat to exert an amazing amount of privilege

7981,Don t forget the bunch of tweets about Tony Gwynn   I think they said it would take a few hours to go through the materials   There is not any company that would think it s ok for a worker to tweet 100  times a day  and then say they don t have time to do some mandatory stuff 
7982,"They re also arguing a president has absolute immunity  while he s blaming Obama for illegal spying and whatever the  Obamagate  crime is   

They ve argued previously that a president can t be investigated  and also that the only remedy to a check a criminal president is impeachment  which requires investigation   

The doublethink is astounding "
7983,As a silver lining  though  I m reasonably sure that if the FBI knocked on my door and told me that by some random legal quirk I had to be president  I wouldn t be the worst at it  The only sentences out of my mouth would be  What do the experts recommend   followed by  Then let s do that    sure  but I feel like that s better than what we have now

It should be an explicit requirement  no more complex than being 35 years old is  If our government can t perform standard oversight procedures on you while you re president  that doesn t mean no oversight  it means you re unfit to hold the office "
7992,God forbid someone should harass and distract the president  infringing on his abilities to harass and distract the rest of the world 
7993,Why this guy has been able to surf through 70  years without being called to task on his shenanigans is nothing short of mind boggling  Yeah  I get that he s been born into privilege  etc etc but he s also moving in some circles where the people he s now crossing swords with are also born of privilege   I hope the reckoning is coming soon for him

8006,Just reading through USA weekly stories is funny  because humour comes from the darkest places of how a nation is being strangled by politics while people die of pandemic  It just took one inappropriate POTUS to strip USA of its global stature and trust  I do hope yo guys recover and achieve the status I as a child always imagined you to be 
8007,Trump literally has access to the world s most sophisticated intelligence network  but he can never seem to bring forward evidence from them   hmm 
8008,Wow  look at that tweet from the president where he openly spews Russian propaganda  They have been trying to turn Bernie voters for months by attacking the democratic establishment for their treatment of Bernie  and now the president is jumping on board so he can try to convince more Bernie voters to not vote for the guy Bernie endorsed

Trump isn t even being subpoenaed  Banking institutions which hold the records being sought are being subpoenaed  Trump doesn t have to come up with documents  organize them  and turn them over  All he has to do is literally nothing  But literally doing nothing would be so taxing on the presidency that he has committed White House counsel resources to fighting them instead "

8027,He may not be smart but he knows more people voting is bad for him and the republicans   When Trump loses if the GOP loses the senate as well he will have a lot less protection and ability to cover up or ignore his crimes  
8028,By Trump logic  that means Trump is part of a conspiracy  and murdered someone 
8029,Being his lawyer has to be one of the most frustrating jobs on the planet  Not that I feel sorry for them  they chose to represent him and are probably awful people themselves  It s hilarious though that every time they make an argument he completely undoes everything they said almost immediately 
8030,Man  I ve always thought crime was hard to do  but who could have predicted that you could simply argue your way to the Supreme Court that you re too busy to be invested
8031,"I m hoping that the Supreme Court is a compromised sack of worm dirt  but that they ll be so disappointed with how soft headed the Trump defense team s story is that they ll just reject every goddamned thing they say    


Like  if they had come up with anything at all constitutionally sound and ran out the clock on procedural challenges  the Court would say   Oh  that s only fair    But the fact that their defense is pretty much   King Joffrey shit the bath and we have to clean it up  Can t we just skip this whole court thing     the court will have to re assert some of its co equalness "

8066,Trump is three bad tweets and one investigation that peters out before any real work is done from declaring himself king for life  Fucking makes me sick how much he screws everyone else over to make sure he gets the best of everything

8088,I find it hilarious his new distraction is to lie to the people by telling them he is taking hydroxychloroquine so he can make more money from it  I very much doubt he is taking this drug  A reporter asked him today how many doses he has left to take and he answered by saying  I don t 1 or 2 more doses and then turned to his doctor to ask him   I m pretty sure you would know how many doses you have left to take especially if you are a man who claims to have to best memory  I believe either he has a investment into the drug or this is one big distraction to steer the media away from all the cases he is losing in the courts right now  There is the tax return Supreme Court case and the multi level marketing scam that his whole family is being sued for in court

8123,It s not like we need an investigation  Somebody probably already has a record of all his tweets  That should be enough to remove him  Plus  someone else probably has a bunch of the video evidence  Add that together and why the fuck wasn t he removed 3 years ago

 I highly doubt the Democrats would do it though because they could potentially hold the office for the next 8 years 

They will absolutely do it  because many of the ways Turnp has abused his power are cases where previous presidents were limited by convention instead of law   Everyone sort of assumed that no president would be so awful as to break these long standing and well supported  morally  historically  conventions   but then along came Turnp    

So a large part of the task is simply to change many of these conventions into actual law 

Another part of the task is refine the structure of the executive so that it s more difficult for the president adminstration to simply ignore the law 

I think the Democrats will have zero issues with such changes  because they don t actually add any practical restrictions on those who govern in good faith which the Democrats do "

Hans Ulrich Rudel  the top Stuka pilot of the war  recalled twice meeting Goering dressed in outlandish costumes  first  a medieval hunting costume  practicing archery with his doctor  and second  dressed in a red toga fastened with a golden clasp  smoking an unusually large pipe 


 Italian Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano once noted Goering wearing a fur coat that looked like what  a high grade prostitute wears to the opera   He threw lavish housewarming parties each time a round of construction was completed at Carinhall  and changed costumes several times throughout the evenings  


Hermann Goering was the most of his life morphine addicted  painted his feet and finger nails and played with little trains and toys 


Goering was noted for his patronage of music  especially opera  He entertained frequently and sumptuously  and hosted elaborate birthday parties for himself  Armaments minister Albert Speer recalled that guests brought expensive gifts such as gold bars  Dutch cigars  and valuable artwork  For his birthday in 1944  Speer gave Goering an oversize marble bust of Hitler

For anyone who doesn t want to read the whole thing   My recollection and understanding   The basic notion is that the Federal government does not pay for meeting refreshments  esp for employees of the government and those who are trying to influence them in their official decision making  are not eligible for free refreshments  nor may they provide refreshments to those representing the Federal government   

Foreign guests of the Department of State  state level banquets  ambassadorial relations  esp if hosted by the POTUS or VP and Cabinet heads  it is OK for Uncle Sam to pick up the tab  expected as a part of relationships with other countries

If Government is the problem when Republicans are in charge  how about we try putting someone else in charge of it "
9019," The Government is the Problem  is consistent with language of bigots  It is not a principle of believing in no government or small government   The Government  is a code word for Democratic Party  This is similar when people say  Immigrants are the problem   even though virtually everyone in the US are immigrants or descendants of immigrants  

Republican voters and politicians have been consistent in believing in big Republican government for years  

For example  Republican politicians like to say that they are pro deregulation in energy when in reality they actively intervene the market to suppress renewable energy and support oil coal natural gas  This is a government by corny capitalists 

Another feature of Trump is rule by person instead of clearly defined regulations  Yes  there is less written and commonly understood regulations  The regulations are whatever Trump decides  During impeachment  Trump claimed unlimited power to do whatever he wants  The government is as big  if not bigger  but it is less fair 

EDIT  Someone responded that  Can we not water down  bigotry  to include partisan politics    I replied the best I could to the person  but it went into  both sides are same  direction  

My main points are

1  Racial bigotry is intertwined with partisan politics
2  Career civil servants and judges are supposed to be apolitical but Republican voters and politicians make them political  
3  Republican voters and politicians dislike career civil servants and judges just because they are doing their jobs and don t not follow their bigotry 
4  In other words  they extend their racial bigotry by association

9122,"I didn t know anything about Earnhardts Jr politics so I googled  from wikipedia    
Politics
In a 2004 interview with Mike Wallace  not fellow competitor  on 60 Minutes  Earnhardt revealed himself to be a Republican and a supporter of President George W  Bush  81  Despite this  he took his crew out to see the film Fahrenheit 9 11 earlier that year  82  83  explaining   I like hearing both sides of the argument  I thought the movie was well done  But my dad was a Republican  and I m a Republican  and so  it s  not that I came out of there going   I ain t voting for Bush again   That didn t happen  and I didn t expect that to happen  I just wanted to go and enjoy the movie   81 

Earnhardt is a longtime opponent of the modern display of the Confederate flag at NASCAR events  84  He wrote in his 2001 autobiography Driver  8 about his experience being asked about the flag in a Q A at Richmond International Raceway  now Richmond Raceway  the previous year  84   I think it means something different to me than it does to y all     he responded  84  He has distanced himself from race fans who display the flag  explaining   It never really was me   81  In 2006  Earnhardt told Dan Wetzel of Yahoo  Sports   We live in a country where you can speak freely and do as you may  I don t know  if  what that flag stands for is the same for me as it is the guy who might have it flying out there  I am not going to agree with everything everybody does all my life  So I don t have any control over it   85  Following the Charleston church shooting in 2015  Earnhardt told reporters   I think it s offensive to an entire race  It does nothing for anybody to be there flying  so I don t see any reason  It belongs in the history books and that s about it   86 

In January 2009  Earnhardt expressed enthusiasm following President Barack Obama s inauguration   I m as excited as everybody else is about him  I wish I had been able to go to the inauguration  I would love to meet him  That would be a great honor   87 

In April 2012  Earnhardt became a partner of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity  88  He addressed delegates to the 2012 Democratic National Convention at Charlotte Motor Speedway on behalf of the coalition  89  In 2014  Earnhardt recorded an advertisement for America s Power  encouraging voter turnout for the U S  elections that year  90 

In May 2012  Earnhardt singled out Republican Representative Jack Kingston of Georgia while speaking against an amendment to a defense bill that would prohibit the military from funding sponsorships in professional sports  91 

In January 2017  Earnhardt revealed that his family immigrated from Germany in the 1770s to escape religious persecution  saying  America is created by immigrants   92  93  In August  he spoke out against hatred  bigotry and racism following the attacks in Charlottesville  Virginia and Barcelona  Spain  94  In September  after protests of the U S  national anthem gained traction following criticism from President Donald Trump  Earnhardt expressed support for peaceful protesters  quoting former president John F  Kennedy on Twitter   Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable   95 "

9128,I used to shoot long bows  recurve bows  my partner made them  and a crossbow when I was younger  Not a one of them were easy to draw  So  in the vein of the Joffrey comparison  it isn t completely accurate because they don t have the upper body strength to nock or draw any kind of bow save those little plastic ones with the braided string and suction cup arrows

He is actively undermining and threatening State s authority for strictly political reasons  and yet again threatening to violate the Constitution  This time  Article 1 Section 4 

The Executive has no authority over how States handle their elections without Congressional action  None 

These acts of authoritarian cosplay going on in the White House continue to go unchecked as the Senate  driven by their own opportunistic cynical game  remains complicit to his dangerous game

  Trump is threatening to withhold federal funds from these states because he contends that sending out absentee ballot applications will benefit Democrats 

  These particular messages are part of a new genre Trump seems to be trying out  the tattletale tweet  in which he tags in some other authority and demands they take action 

  These messages are a little strange on their face  since Trump could easily call Vought or Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and order him to withhold funds to Michigan or Nevada  he could call Pai or Graham privately too

It s not a gamble at all  He s gotten away with everything so far and there s no evidence that is going to change "
9146,"it seems like once you ve gotten away with X  you ll have no fear committing acts less problematic than X  and very little fear committing acts only slightly worse than X 

he s gotten away with literal treason in the form of colluding with a foreign power to manipulate an election   why would he think he could be punished now "
9147,Easiest way to stop this is for Twitter to suspend his account  It s obvious he s violated their TOS on numerous occasions   Too bad they re too cowardly to actually do it 
9148,Who s going to stop him   The DOJ   The FEC   The Senate   The man is a king until he s voted out of office and he knows it  why doesn t everyone else

Don t let a lack of imagination catch you flat footed  These people are brazen criminals "
9151,The president   has gotten away with everything up to this point    If Americans don t make an example of him in November  millions will die as America enters a civil war and collapses  which may also precipitate a world war 
9152,I used to think that it was kind of an exaggeration to be like  Oh Trump is a fascist and he s going to turn America fascist now   back in 2016 17  Now I see it their way 
9153,Shouldn t twitter like suspend his account  He is literally trying to cut down our democracy with their platform

9156,Gambling  It s a pretty safe bet nothing will happen 
9157,In what sense is it a  gamble   What episode from his presidency so far leads anyone to think he  won t  get away with them  The federal government is not capable of holding itself accountable  period 
9158,Did somebody say 2nd Amendment 
9159,Of course  no one wants to stop him  so why would he stop 
9160,Well  he s gotten away with everything so far   
9161,Worked last time 
9162,Him and the Republicans are getting away with everything and their supporters don t care at all  No reason for them to change now 
9163,If only we had a system of checks and balances that actually worked
9164,Why not   He s gotten away with everything else   He s changing American politics and decorum expectations forever   Liberals are trying to play hardball  but they seem incapable or unwilling to stoop as low as this administration   I would prefer they don t  but I don t know if not doing so will be good enough to win the election   There are about 40ish percent of American voters who are completely unwavering in their support of Trump and the Republican Party   Scary time to be an American   Empires and civilizations rarely collapse overnight 
9165,Of course he is  Senate Republicans have made it perfectly clear that he is free to break the law whenever it suits him

9171,He gets away with everything  including extorting another country s head of state for political dirt on Biden  so why wouldn t he get away with threatening states with quid pro quos 
9172,Wasn t there a President that once got impeached for doing something similar where he said that he would withhold funds if they did not do what he wanted  I believe they called it Quid Pro Quo  This seems very similar

9179,"What gamble  he s been tweeting threats since Twitter has come out and nothing bad has happened to him  why would he see any reason to change course now 

Lol these  breaking  articles that Trump is doing exactly what he s done forever and everyone is surprised for some reason"

9181,Trump and his lackeys DO NOT WANT free and fair elections  it s the main thing that the impeachment trial was about

9188,Yes  but    why wouldn t he  It s his only shot of winning again  And he s a serial lifetime achievement liar and cheater in every sense of the word  And he commits obvious crimes in plain sight and nobody does anything  to stop him  He s insanely rational that way   without a sparrow s fart of shame  restraint or decency  why wouldn t he do literally anything to cling to his narrow path to power 
9189,Fuck Twitter   If they can t pick one of President Tweety s examples  and there are many  of violating their terms of agreement to shut his account down they can go s a d 
9190,Why not  He s gotten away with everything else  Nobody with the power to has the balls to stop him  Or they re openly complicit 
9191,It s worked for 3 5 years why stop now

9193,Fuck you trump
9194,Doesn t matter if he announces his transgressions in advance  Republicans will do nothing to hold him accountable 
9195,Somebody needs to punch this guy in the dick
9196,What is the gamble for him  He s right  His entire life has been a never ending series of him getting away with things 
9197,Welp  he clearly learned his lesson  didn t he Susan 
9198,"Reminder  Trump has gotten away with everything so far  No reason to think that  more  election interference will be any different 

We thought Hillary would surely beat that clown  We thought Congress would keep him in check  We thought Mueller would put him in jail  We thought the GOP held Senate would convict him  Now  we think that Biden will oust him in November  We keep hoping and believing that a hero will save us  When the hell are we going to wake up and save ourselves "
9199,"This critique is missing two key elements 

1  a Senate that would hold him accountable

2  a public that unifies in their outrage over abuses of power 

Trump supporters eat any shit Trump says  so his narrative of voter fraud is accepted whole cloth   There is no push back from the voters  so therefore the Senators don t do anything about it   If Nixon could have openly tweeted about what he was doing  he would have been impeached faster "
9200,I really wonder what conservatives think about this federal overreach of state s powers 
9201, Trump appears to be tweeting his threats openly  because he knows that means he ll get away with them 
9202,How about the President has no standing to tell any State how to run their elections  And that every State has it s own Election Board that is actually in charge and if it decided on mail in ballots then that is that 
9203,Not gambling if he knows it ll work on the simpletons 
9204,It s the combination of qualified personnel quitting in protest and Trump firing people at high level positions to install his cronies that s letting him get away with things  Don t think he also hasn t noticed how there isn t a mass protest outside his window every time he bends the law a little more each day 
9205,It s worked so far 
9206,"I mean      he will get away with it  

He s already gotten away with it  

Holding back congressional approved money for political game      we already had an impeachment over that  As long as McConnell leads the senate he s untouchable and he knows it "
9207,This is just disgusting  I am so ashamed of my country and the millions of people voting for this egomaniac
9208,Didnt he or someone say it wasnt a crime if you say your gonna do it  Or something along those lines  
9209,"Trump has probably had to deal with blackmail on both sides of it his entire life 

He probably realized that it s better to face embarrassment than to be on someone s hook 

so his default strategy is just to say the bad parts out loud in hopes it takes away power from those that would use the information against him "
9210,is it a gamble if the strategy has and continues to work  as long as he says the quite part out loud no one in the GOP cares 
9211, Gambling   No  he s just doing it because he knows he won t face any consequences as long as he s in power  His list of crimes is so massive that doing more is only to his advantage   either he manages to keep power  or he s screwed even if he stopped committing crimes today 
9212,America is a failed state   he will get away with it 
9213, Appears to be gambling   How about  is well aware of the fact   There s no mystery at this point over whether Trump can get away with this stuff  He can  and he knows it

Jesus Christ  conservatives  are y all blind  deaf  and dumb or just that far down the white nationalist propaganda rabbit hole   

Here s a hint   When you became ok with that shitshow of an inaugural speech by President Twitty  went on to hate  shithole countries  and be ok with kids in cages  you might have wanted to take a second look at your politics 

At this point there is no excuse for still being on the Trump bandwagon besides blind allegiance to a political party that stands for nothing but greed and power "
9216,Hes not gambling shit he knows he s protected
9217,This is embarrassing  I hope there is a massive turnout to vote his ass to prison 
9218,It s worked with everything else he s done  so why not 
9219,He will get away with it   We ve shown that now   Over  and over  and over 
9220,His supporters have gone along with it       scary and stupid
9221,I think Biden vs trump going Joe s way is entirely based on his VP choice   Joe obviously has something happening mentally its glaringly obvious so the vp will be carrying the weight
9222,They let him get away with everything else  Whats different about this  Apparently what you say on twitter has no ramifications in real life  SMH 
9223,What gamble  The senate stated it openly  All he has to say is  country s best interests  and it s legal  no matter what it is 
9224,Trump could tweet that  legal thing  is illegal and his supporters and republican lemmings will follow suit
9225,Until he s either impeached  and then prosecuted  or voted out  and then prosecuted  he already has

  Puts an ally in postmaster general in hopes of stressing or holding back mail in ballots  Check 

  Threaten states that are offering ballots to be mailed in or contained within their states  Check "
9227,That worked just fine for him before   Maybe this time    no  never mind 
9228,It s worked for him so far  why change it up now 
9229,Yeah  Why should today be any different 
9230,I mean  they haven t been wrong yet 
9231,Reimpeach and remove this fucking time
9232,Its worked so far   
9233,He s getting desperate 
9234,That was literally the argument during impeachment   It s only a crime if he tries to hide it  
9235,he will
9236,People who call themselves  conservative  think this is great 
9237,Twat twaddle tweety strikes again 
9238,Everyone is brazenly interfering with the elections  Reddit is brazenly interfering in the elections 
9239,It s crazy   I imagine a lot of his followers wouldn t in their wildest dreams have ever thought this kind of behavior is okay  but since it s him  they immediately change their paper thin values on a dime  It s basically  whatever Trump does is fine by me 
9240,Kind of irrelevant  but why is Trump not saluting that soldier  It was a pretty big deal for a president not to salute them   lattegate
9241,What s the risk  SCOTUS won t take it up until after the election  and will grant an injunction to allow Trump to do his worst until the case is mooted 
9242,"Yeah  why wouldn t he  The Senate won t remove him for any reason  Trump s gonna go increasingly nuts in a very public fashion for the remainder of his term  Everybody was talking about this exact situation as a probable consequence when Moscow Mitch decided a quick party line acquittal was all they needed to do about his bribe solicitation from Ukraine s president  

Nothing can be legally done about Trump s behavior until November  unless the GOP Senate grows a conscience or Bill Barr decides to test the internal DoJ memo protecting Trump from prosecution  Best of luck to those waiting on either of those eventualities  Sincerely  It s up to the people now  Can we vote in high enough numbers to overcome GOP led voter suppression and intimidation    and rid ourselves of this mad king "
9243,I mean he s openly tweeted other threats and hasn t seen any consequences for them yet  so why would he start worrying now  It s like the republicans are going to hold him accountable  they have already proven they will rig a trial for him 
9244,The guy s never had this much power  Now he s overwhelmed 
9245,Why wouldn t he  What negative consequence has he faced from any of his actions 
9246,I m just thankful we can comment on Atlantic articles on Reddit since they removed their section  Bring back the comment section and I ll gladly start paying for articles after the fifth 
9247,"I mean  it definitely will let him get away with it  Source  his entire fucking term as president 

God fucking damn it "
9248,I mean  it s worked so far   
9249,"So far it has  There seems to be know one to challenge him  No law that can stop him  He laughs at Congress when threatened to bring a legal challenge to stop and desist  The Republican senate turns a blind eye and continues to march the goose step behind him  His base is a lost cause they idolize his rhetoric  

                Welcome to the new America "
9250,It s worked so far for him   
9251,Trump s testing the waters like he did with his other crimes   
9252,"That s exactly what s gonna happen  Manipulation 

Crime this
Treason that
Witch hunt this
Disgrace that"
9253,The turner diaries
9254,He was impeached and the senate decided he s learned his lesson so he s going to behave  What else can anyone do  Seriously  I want to know
9255,"Wow  if only we let Congress make decisions for how to spend money like the government is supposed to work  

But  next time we have a Democrat president  this idea will be considered wrong again by publications like the Atlantic "
9256, He got away with it  
9257,Yum  my butterball in Chief  Fuck this greasy moron  get the fuck on board
9258,Again   
9259,Why do his legs always look broken 
9260,"Well  to that I say   When hasn t it

9261,Basically this is Trump saying  We re trying to suppress the vote and this makes it EASIER TO VOTE AND THAT S CHEATING     
9262," Appears to be gambling that openly tweeting his threats will let him get away with them  

Gambling  He isn t gambling at all  He gets away with everything "
9263,That s the one takeaway he s gotten from the past three years isn t it   If he tweets his destruction of the US government openly  the Republicans just blame Obama right 
9264,And y all will let him
9265,Yep  and it s going to fucking work too  Either the Democrats in the Senate and Congress are outnumbered 100 to 1 and we don t know it for some reason or they don t actually give a shit either  just like their Republican colleagues   I m hard pressed to think of another conclusion at this point 
9266,The fucker will with Barr as AG and Moscow Mitch   the GoP controlling the Senate   
9267,Absolutely unacceptable and he has suffering from narcissistic personality disorder something that the 25th amendment should have dealt with 
9268,So far he has shown he can get away with what he wants anyway  so fuck it right

democracy is the punchline"

He nominated himself for  Chief of Getting Away With Anything   and the Senate confirmed him    

The question is whether it s a lifetime appointment  or whether the people have oversight to nullify that confirmation "
9272,"Come on  Atlantic   No  he s openly tweeting his threats so that he can garner violent popular support for them 

This analysis is facile  We can do better   We have to do better or we are going to lose again "

9287,   and it will 
9288,Yea  cuz that s never worked before  And it will work again
9289,Looks at Jack Dorsey
9290,It s hardly a gamble  He s violated the constitution over a dozen times  no reason to stop now
9291,Well do you blame him at this point  Hes being doing this for years in office with no consequences now  The government wont hold him accountable  and the worst that happens is people complain on here about it
9292,When 80 90  of the governments power is on your side and is just as if not more so corrupted as you  it s only a few steps away from being a dictator  So far  he s been able to avoid prison  being removed from the seat of president  and a few other little bits of trouble  He more than likely now feels like hes invincible  and possibly untouchable  He continuously slaps down anything that challenges him with bullshit loopholes  or just by making those going after him to pause for a moment while he officially fires them   
9293,Why not  He s been doing this for literally years now  why would there be consequences this time 
9294,I mean     from past fucking evidence    I d say probably so 
9295,So mailing out letters to sign up for mail in ballots is cheating  While everything is shut down for a virus outbreak  Is he trying to copy Diddy s Vote or Die campaign 
9296,The coup will be complete if he is reelected 
9297,Let s impeach him again   Fuck it  Twice more   Once for his role in hiding CDC data and again for this   The evidence is all there   He can t claim he has time for site visits or campaign rallies if he says he s too busy about the work of the country to be subpoenaed 
9298,It s not gambling if you already paid the refs 
9299,Americans let this go on too long  Now it is irreversible and the nation will pay with its life  The United States of America is gone 
9300,I mean  he is gonna get away with them  Who s gonna stop him 
9301,nah he s always done that
9302,He s gotten away with every other fucking thing  what the hell makes the latest threat to our democracy any different 
9303,Seems like there are some court cases to be filed based on this intimidation  yes 
9304,Well he s not gambling  it s worked so far 
9305,"Our media have absolutely no idea how to handle that   I truely believe that the only reason he was impeached over Ukraine is that there was a clumsy coverup about that call and a whistleblower complaint 

If he had just asked Ukraine and China to investigate Biden on the lawn heading to his helichopter  there would have been a day or so of news stories and a week of op eds and panel discussions about how this was  not normal  and  possibly illegal   but no action would have been taken "
9306,They argued about Ukraine extortion   He didn t know it was that bad so it s really unfair to remove him over it

9313,I don t know if we can call it cos play any more   
9314,"  The Federal Government has no authority over how States handle their elections  None 

That s just not true   Article 1 section 4 explicitly states 

Elections  Meetings  The Times  Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives  shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof    but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations    except as to the Place of Chusing Senators 

So congress can make laws that regulate the conduct of elections   That s why the voting rights act of 1965 was constitutional "
9315," but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations  except as to the places of choosing Senators 

This is probably the angle they re going to play  It s vague enough that they can say they are going to  alter such regulations  "

9337,What kind of dictator relinquishes power after he is voted out 
9338,The answer has been Yes for years 
9339,Not yet  When he loses the election and refuses to acknowledge the result  and is left in power  THEN we ll be a dictatorship 
9340,Honestly based on the majority of people I come in contact with on a day to day basis  the people who put him in office in the first place  I m becoming disillusioned with democracy  Much of our population is not only uneducated and naive  but simply refuses to stay properly informed or even learn how their own government functions or what their rights are as citizens  These people do so much harm to our system and impede any means of progress  I m beginning to think the only way america can really thrive is to abandon our current form of government and create a new one

9376,Our media belongs to them and it s messaging shows it 
9377,"I also think it applies to why he was able to get away with it  A bad cover up was what prompted the inquiry  but they very quickly released the transcript of the call which  despite what he said  was very incriminating  However because that came up so early people quickly got used to it  and the investigation had no smoking gun to build to because it was already out there and there was time for the smoke to clear  

If that transcript came to light during the actual impeachment  after all the testimony I think it could have actually had an impact on the outcome and public opinion "

Not to say good Journalism doesn t exist  You just have to actively seek good sources  be literate in determining credibility  and be willing to take in new information  The media that most voters consume just gives permission to keep believing whatever it is you believe because we are split on the issues  even if one side is blatantly lying

I never understand that  I mean it s hard to defend Trump  even my keyboard start to melting   but I never treated it as a real offer  I mean what that supposed to mean  that some guy in Russia was watching TV and hearing that assumed signed contract   
That was just Trump playing to ratings nothing more   


I mean now we know how many shady business he has so it actually could be possible  that contracts were already signed  or whatever kind of deal you make in hacking world   and he said to them to wait for his signal on national TV  or something  Nothing is impossible anymore 

  x200B 

With Bidens s son it s different story  there are actual documented moments of making actual offer 

  x200B 

There is a difference between me saying on national TV  if any assassin is hearing me please kill my wife    and catching me on the phone with assassin  asking him for a favor in exchange for money  Not mention that whole part where I m just a post office worker and money I m offering in exchange are not mine I m just here to deliver it anyway

My analysis starts with the 2016 Electoral College map and I can t really find any state that went for Clinton in 2016 that I think will go Trump in 2020  So Trump needs to hold what he won  306 EC votes   270 needed to win   So if he loses any combination of three of these states  he loses the general  AZ  MI  PA  WI  FL  or GA  And in every one of these states Biden leads in the polls right now  And if Trump loses FL  then Biden only needs one more of these states 

Michigan isn t the only key state  but I d say it s really an important one to watch

The Republican Senate let him commit crimes 

Not some of them 

ALL of them 

Every last one 

Romney included 

When they try to pretend that they had nothing to do with this shitshow  their voting record will stand as proof 

This is why we impeached even though we knew they would not find him guilty 

That makes them guilty

9704,Man  how I d LOVE to se a democrat take Georgia  But he probably won t because of Georgia s wonderful record of voter suppression 
9705,I imagine Biden will need to be up by at least 10 points in GA to overcome the GOP cheating factor 
9706,Also  Kelly leads McSally  Arizona  by a huge margin in a state where it hasn t gone to a democrat in 30 years 
9707,I don t know if Georgia and Texas are turning blue  this  year but they will by the end of the decade 
9708,Biden needs to focus on the core swing states  Don t worry bout racking up the score  just go for the win  A landslide repudiation would be fantastic  but focus on the win first

Since they re essentially of the same mind  it s easy to see how Biden could come away with Georgia "
9710,Trump s down in Michigan  Pennsylvania  North Carolina  Florida  and Arizona   Barely breaking even in Ohio  Texas  and Georgia   Biden s about to carve out the future path forward for Democratic nominees  and it s going to be a weird hybrid of Obama s 2012 win  and Bill Clinton s 1996 win 
9711,I m going to be honest  though  Clinton was ahead of Trump in 2016 here in Georgia  too  for a couple months  And even when Trump pulled ahead  he only got 3 5 points up at best  I d love for this state to turn  but I lost faith in the white trash in the hills years ago 
9712,"As a Georgian  never say never but I doubt Trump loses here  

Registered voter surveys often overestimate Democrat support by 2 5 points compared to likely voter polls  

Biden has a unique strength among black voters in Georgia however  So I could see the margin being closer than in 2016 "
9713,Don t care  Vote 
9714,Polls don t matter  Corrupt Kemp is governor  No way the GOP is going to allow GA to go blue  no matter how the actual votes go 
9715,I still think Biden has a very good chance of being Trump  If you say anything positive about Hillary online or in real life  steam comes out of their ears  Hillary was truly hated  and it s possible that Trump only won the first time because Hillary was so despised 
9716,If only Georgia was a true democracy instead of a third world failed state 
9717,"If it looks like Biden is leading in Georgia  or Florida or Wisconsin or Ohio   the state can suspend their election in November for public health reasons or electoral fraud or whatever   Then the GOP controlled state government can pass an emergency resolution to restore their ability to appoint Electors  which is a Constitutional power reserved by the states  to the Electoral College 

They appoint a GOP leaning slate of Electors without an election and in defense against a popular vote that isn t going to go their way 

This is a perfectly legal and Constitutional way to ensure that Georgia  Florida  Ohio  Wisconsin  Texas  or Arizona don t flip "

When Democrats mobilize  the vote flips  It literally takes a turnout "
9721,Doesn t matter    polls mean shit if folks don t get off their god damn asses and vote 
9722,Biden baby  Bring those strong unions back
9723,Has anyone else noticed that Georgia and Texas both only turned into permanent red states after they installed electronic voting machines 
9724,Exciting but I don t see Biden carrying Georgia considering who their governor is  Kemp is going to do everything he can to steal another election 
9725,Hillary did the same thing  at one point 
9726,I just hope people don t hear about these polls and get complacent about voting  Hilary Clinton was also supposed to win  Every single person who can vote needs to vote 
9727,Trump is like that guy that s horrible in bed that converts his wife to lesbianism  but in politics  converting red states to blue 
9728,Get out and vote Georgia   Make these polls so wrong   make Biden CRSUH IT in Georgia 
9729,I hope Trump loses GA and Texas  It will probably be all over for him if that happens 
9730,I m not greedy  I ll be perfectly happy if Biden wins Texas  That s all I ask 
9731,How beautiful would it be if both coasts go blue  From California and Nevada and possibly Arizona     to Washington state  and from Florida to Maine  South Carolina is  4 Trump so that would be the hardest obstacle

So anything state wide would great"
9743,Nothing against the OP  but I don t like it when news outlets use the parties as labels  Forget the party names   it would likely be the first time Georgia voted to elect a left leaning candidate  what  ever 
9744,I already know how this election will go  Biden will win by a landslide  Trump will make up anything to disqualify the results  Trumps base will become animated  Fox will go with it  Hopefully there s a transition of power  but it won t be pleasant if it happens

9750,All these conventional red states need is a  white old man  to flip  If Biden could get a bit of racism or be a bully  it will be a slum dunk 🤣
9751,Well they might have voted for one for governer if their votes got counted
9752,Gerogia is led by an illegitimate governer who cheated to win his election and who just canceled an election to illegitimately appoint a Supreme Court judge  There is no way in Hell Biden wins there  regardless of what the actual vote count is
9753,Have no fear  the GOP will just  arrange it  so Trump wins  There is no actual voting going on in those red states  The electoral college can  vote  their conscience and keep all those misinformed poor people from making a big mistake 
9754,Let s not start sucking each other s dicks just yet
9755,Maybe they re tired of watching republicans subverting democracy 
9756,Question for Georgia voter  is it true in some districts  Trump was the only presidential candidate on the ballot  My friend s elderly aunt tried to vote and her ballot only had Trump on it 
9757,"Way too far out for these polls to matter 

Also remember when far out polls were discredited as not mattering whenever they showed Bernie doing well somewhere  or vs Trump  etc 

If they didn t matter for him far out  they don t matter for Biden either  And shit  clearly they didn t matter as we saw the primary do a complete 180 in a matter of 3 days  The media can twist public perception very easily  intentionally or not  especially in the final lead up 

Do not make the mistake of being remotely confident Biden has this in the bag  There are months to go  and this will be an election Republicans will do everything in their power to steal   no matter the numbers real or not "

9766,Thanks for taking me back to the simpler time of 2016 when we read poll after poll showing Clinton beating Trump in very red states  Hope someone addressed the issue with virtually every poll back then being wrong 
9767,"Ummmm 
Still vote guys "
9768,"Stop it  

Overconfidence accounts for a big part of the Kerry and Clinton defeats  Get up by 10  in the Rust Belt states and 7  in some battleground Midwestern states  

Then go after the purplish bits of the Bible Belt  if there s time and resources and everything else is locked down  

The goal of humiliating Trump by picking up traditionally safe red states is a bad gamble fueled by ego 100  of the focus must be a realistic strategy to win"

9844,"  Biden needs to focus on the core swing states  Don t worry bout racking up the score  just go for the win  A landslide repudiation would be fantastic  but focus on the win first 

That being said  if Trump somehow managed to pull a reverse Mondale I would probably die from laughter "
9845,Biden s handlers are keeping him out of the public eye as much as possible for a reason  guy can barely talk his dementia has progressed so much  How the DNC gets away with this obvious elder abuse is mystifying  At least the Republican voters don t care about anything but hating black people so nobody cares about the GOP abusing their senior 
9846,I still expect  having lived in Georgia for a while  that there are a lot of people who are cranky about things now  but will somehow rationalize to themselves that they simply  have  to vote for the Republican  just because it s what their grandpappy would have wanted  or because fetuses  or someone s gonna take their guns  somehow   or they re gonna be rich  someday  so better not let the taxes on the wealthy go up  November is still a long way away  and the active propaganda ads haven t really hit hard  yet

This election is still very much anyone s game  and if the democrats have the same attitude they had in 2016 of being 100  that they can t possibly lose  they ll be putting their chances of winning in real jeopardy "
9852,"  Trump s down in Michigan  Pennsylvania  North Carolina  Florida  and Arizona  Barely breaking even in Ohio  Texas  and Georgia  

Believe nothing  Trust nothing  Assume nothing 

There will be massive election fraud in all 50 states this year the likes of which the country has not seen since Huey Long  The only solution is for every single eligible voter to fight themselves red in tooth and claw to get to the polls and vote  because it s going to be like a fucking Marine obstacle course of voter suppression to get there

In liberal areas you had so called  Rockefeller Republicans  who were socially liberal     In the south  you had  Southern Democrats  who were still heavily influenced by how the Democrat party was before the Civil Rights Movement  segregationist  socially conservative  etc     So conservative voters in the south didn t have a problem voting for a Democrat just like liberal voters in a place like California didn t have problems voting for a Republican 

Those politicians have for the most part been superseded by subsequent generations of politicians    There are few socially conservative Democrats and socially liberal Republicans anymore   Thus socially liberal areas rarely have a reason to vote Republican and socially conservative areas rarely have a reason to vote Democrat any longer "

9899,Your account has  throwaway  in the title  Do you even intend on keeping it active until the election 
9900,"You familiar with how probability works 

Roll a die  look at whatever number it lands on  and realize that unlikelihoods happen "
9901," right 

No 

 The public polling actually was in fact more accurate this year than it was in 2012  They were a lot closer to what the race was this year than they were in 2012 when I was on the Obama campaign looking at the public polling  Very few of the public pollsters actually had Obama at 51 percent there at the end 

 The narrative was  we want to believe this was a two person race  Hillary always had a big advantage there  But she also generally had an advantage in the four person race  including Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein   But understand  in the four person race Hillary Clinton was never nationally over 47 percent  She was always in fact around 48 or 47  and in the end that s where she landed  When you look at this race as a four person race and then see college educated white voters in fact breaking back to the party that they tend to vote for  the national polling actually completely nailed where this race was 

 When you look at the exit data  you have 8 or 9 percent of younger African Americans voting third party  You have 6 or 7 percent of younger Latinos voting third party  Hillary is almost off Barack Obama s winning margins by the same percentage of our young people voting third party  So that s how  Trump  squeaked in 

 Again  Trump didn t expand the Republican tent  He didn t bring in all these millions upon millions of new Republican voters  This was about Democrats losing  more so than Trump remaking the electorate and winning in some sort of profound and new way  It should not have been a winning percentage  right 

 When you look at why Trump won  it wasn t because Trump over indexed  It was because we under indexed  When you look at battleground state after battleground state  Hillary was off Obama s margins by five or six points and Trump was  at best  one or two points up in Michigan or Wisconsin or Florida  Again  it wasn t like he was four  five points better than Mitt Romney  It was that she was five or six points below what Barack Obama did

9902,Or appoint someone to run the election who has a vested interest in winning  Kind of like they ran the last governor s race 
9903,"Thing is  they actually can do this 

I m not well versed in Georgia law  but it seems the legislature could simply pass a law declaring Trump  or  the Republican candidate   the recipient of all electors regardless of vote 

That may be too much   But it would actually not surprise me if they added a clause that temporarily allowed the governor to appoint the electors this year if the Secretary of State felt the election were compromised  related to the pandemic  or some bullshit "
9904,I m across the river  but I m keeping my fingers crossed 
9905,No  not the entire country  A very big reason tRump took the last election is that they campaigned very heavily in the swing states  Most of the red states consist of voters who are too stupid to vote their own interests  or at least the majority of voters in those states  
9906,"As someone who s been trying exactly this for five years now   what the hell is it going to take 

Like  I m at my wits end here  Why the hell is it so damn easy to convince millennials to stay home  It ain t the candidates  because its still pulling teeth for Bernie or a Medical Marijuana ballot measure  It ain t access  because education on early absentee voting doesn t seem to move the needle at all  So what is it 

Because it sure seems like no matter what you do to try and inspire or overcome obstacles  there are six more excuses for not voting  Frankly it doesn t seem like inspiration is going to cut it  You need to get people to see it as their basic friggin  duty to go out  But oh no   we can t shame people for sitting home because Russian propaganda convinced them there s zero difference between whatever options are available 

Voting is like CPR  yeah if you re relying on it it s probably not going to make a huge difference most times  That s not an excuse to sit around and not even try "
9907,Believe me I do  You just don t know how hard it is in an area that s 80   90  republican  I know these numbers are correct because my wife worked the polls in our area for a number of years   that  and the looks I get when people find out I m a liberal 
9908,I d hope they were using some of the money to send something snail mail to the populous  A postcard with a link to voter registration would work wonders

9911,Yeah  gotta get them   black people    felons  off the voter rolls y know 
9912,Yeah gotta factor the Russian and Saudi interference as well 
9913,Well we can tell how the GOP feel about this by looking at their reaction to voting by mail  which inherently leaves a paper trail   And    it s pretty clear that the President is outright  extorting  and otherwise threatening states that try to go this route   It s almost as fishy as if someone destroyed a bunch of drives that were voting fraud evidence 
9914,Actually  yes  that s right  Georgia has already changed to paper ballots 
9915,Not sure if Trump will OD on fish tank cleaner by then so who knows 
9916,Yeah McSally is a uniquely weak candidate to fight against which is nice

9918,Dunno give it a couple months  second wave hits all these people going to tattoo parlors and church and hair cuts and they realize Fox News and their religion doesn t matter to corona virus it gets bad enough soon enough it could be enough to flip for the election   I m more concerned that it will hit the second wave after the damn election when it s too late   Not just the election but also the election they just cancelled for GA courts as well

9920," As an Arizona native  I love this  I ve been donating what I can to his campaign

I drove through Arizona once and I ve been donating to his campaign too  Cheers "
9921,Arizona has only gone democrat 1 time since 1948 with Bill Clinton in 92 with Perot siphoning off a considerable amount from HW and Clinton being a southern Democrat in the dying days  but still relevant  of Democrats ruling the south  It is a significant move forward and a shining example of demographic changes coming to fruition  The coalition that won Clinton the state in 92 is nowhere near what it is now  It s more permanent now  And in my opinion a bellweather for what will happen to Texas 8 12 years down the line
9922,That s one hell of an analogy

9924,2016 was a long time ago    it s a 50   42 lead for Biden right now 
9925,While I absolutely want him to invest a little into NH  it doesn t ultimately matter if Biden wins Pennsylvania and either Michigan or NC   He needs a third state on top of either of those two combinations  but if he gets it from the other  Arizona  or Wisconsin  he will have enough EVs to lose NH  and Maine    Factor in that if he flips Rust Belt states he almost assuredly has held Minnesota  and Nevada  especially if he flips Arizona  and he ll be good to go
9926,"NH is a weird state   college towns mixed with hippies and libertarians  I just moved to rural NH and there are serious pro gun  anti abortion groups who are quite well organized  But then you have these towns that are rapidly filling up with more urban out of staters that are flipping the state blue by conversing and converting independents and people who are disgusted with Trump  despite voting for him   Ultimately a good ground game is key to motivate all these people out the door  because despite the organizational strength of the pro Trump people  they re a minority with few areas to really grow into and could be overwhelmed by the majority of people who are sick of Trump for many reasons 

No wonder Trump is fighting mail in voting   he can only win on people not voting"

9932,Almost any native georgian s grandpappy voted for democrats downballot cause the state didn t flip on presidential races until Goldwater in 1960  and had a Democrat in the governor s office from post reconstruction until 2002  You re right about abortion stance  I would add that a lot of Georgia voters have been fed up with the democratic party s social stances for decades dating back to the 60s when they flipped  meaning gay rights  black enfranchisement  and feminism
9933,Ohio was already one of the redder Midwestern states pre 2016  and it went for Trump by 9 points in 2016   Even as his standing has slipped really badly in Wisconsin  Michigan  and Pennsylvania  he s stayed pretty close to net neutral in Ohio  both in approval and in head to heads with Biden   They also elected a Republican governor in 2018 to replace John Kasich   I m not as bearish as the rest of the Democratic Party is about Ohio  though I also have family ties to that state  so I m not exactly unbiased   but it s not going to be the state that decides if Trump gets a second term or not

9974,"If you live in a state where your vote for president has NEVER been counted because all of its electoral college votes go toward the winner of the majority vote  which is always the party you oppose   you might get discouraged after some time and feel like it s useless  I ve voted in every presidential election in the last 20 years  My vote for president has never been counted  

EDIT  To be clear  I m not saying voting is actually useless if you re outnumbered  I still vote in every presidential election because there are usually other elections happening where my vote DOES count  and I don t know maybe someday my deep red state will turn blue  If my candidate doesn t win the majority vote  it won t be because of me "

 The Democratic
Electorate on
Twitter Is Not
the Actual
Democratic Electorate  https   www nytimes com interactive 2019 04 08 upshot democratic electorate twitter real life html 

 Today s Democratic Party is increasingly perceived as dominated by its  woke  left wing  But the views of Democrats on social media often bear little resemblance to those of the wider Democratic electorate 

 The outspoken group of Democratic leaning voters on social media is outnumbered  roughly 2 to 1  by the more moderate  more diverse and less educated group of Democrats who typically don t post political content online  according to data from the Hidden Tribes Project  This latter group has the numbers to decide the Democratic presidential nomination in favor of a relatively moderate establishment favorite  as it has often done in the past 

 The relative moderation of Democrats who are not sharing their political thoughts on social media  and therefore of Democrats as a whole  makes it less surprising that Virginia Democrats tolerated Mr  Northam s yearbook page  It makes it easier to imagine how Joe Biden might not merely survive questions about whether he touched women in ways that made them feel uncomfortable  but might even emerge essentially unscathed 

 It also helps explain why recent polls show that a majority of Democrats would rather see the party become more moderate than move leftward  even as progressives clamor for a Green New Deal or Medicare for all

10076,Isnt threatening a crime also a crime 
10077,"  Daniel Goldman  the former federal prosecutor who was the House Democrats  counsel in the impeachment of President Trump  posted a video of law professor Pamela Karlan s expert testimony before Congress  Karlan cited presidential extortion of states as an impeachable abuse of power 

Yup  Sounds similar to the Ukraine extortion plot  Hey  Susan Collins  I m not sure he really learned his lesson    🙄😡"
10078,Isn t this literally what he was impeached for   Extorting an entity for political gain   Hmmm     isn t this literally the scenario that one of the legal scholars worried about   Hmmm      good thing those slaps on the wrist worked
10079,"Here is the law he would be breaking 

  Here s what 18 U S  Code § 598 says    emphasis ours    

  Whoever uses any part of any appropriation made by Congress for work relief  relief  or for increasing employment by providing loans and grants for public works projects  or   exercises or administers any authority conferred by any Appropriation Act for the purpose of interfering with  restraining  or coercing any individual in the exercise of his right to vote at any election    shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year  or both 

Didn t the President take an oath to faithfully uphold the laws of the land    🤦🏽‍♂️😡"
10080,"Isn t the threat a crime all on its own 

I d call it extortion 

Kinda like he was doing with Ukraine "
10081,So what  Legal experts have been saying this about many things Trump s administration has done for three years 
10082, Susan Collins has left the chat 
10083,So  Who will prosecute him for it 
10084,Literally nothing would be done about it
10085,But the question is this  does Trump believe it will benefit his reelection or not  Because if he believes his reelection will benefit the country  and he believes this will benefit his reelection  then he cannot be impeached for this  I mean  he can t be charged with this no matter what because the President can t be indicted  and also can t be investigated for anything no matter what  The only recourse against Trump is impeachment  but we already know he can t be impeached if Trump believes what he s doing is for the benefit of the country  So really it doesn t matter whether or not this would be a federal crime  it all comes down to whether Trump thinks he s doing something wrong or not 
10086,That s  kind of  his thing tho right   is this something that someone will actually do something about 
10087,Deja vu    I ve heard this one before 
10088,There is no crime if there is nobody to hold him responsible
10089,Trump claims there is no such thing as a federal crime if it s him  or something he ordered  right 
10090,I m sure the Senate will take immediate action if he carried it out       and by immediate action I mean finding a way to justify it 
10091,He has done it so many times it isn t funny   Ocracoke island in North Carolina got wiped out by a hurricane and they still haven t received any help because the governor is a Democrat  I will be so glad when we get a president in office that pledged allegiance to the United States of American instead of the Republican Party 
10092,"This wouldn t be his first Federal crime so what s the problem 

No one cared about all the bullshit he s done before "
10093,So    impeachable 
10094,What a great way to win over the voters of Michigan  threaten them
10095, There is no such thing as Federal crime for a Republican President     Senate
10096,more crime for the pile you say 
10097,Add it to the pile nothing is going to happen unless the Senate and white house flip or there s a full on revolution 
10098,Fuck that headline   It is a federal crime for Trump to use his position to interfere with an election   The threat should be enough  along with his twitter rants  lies  and misinformation 
10099,If trump keeps stacking the Supreme Court it won t matter what any other legal experts say  Vote Biden in November 
10100,All that Michigan needs to do is cave and it s become a federal crime  Make it clear why you are caving and ask publicize the heck out of it 
10101,When has that ever stopped him   
10102,And who is going to stop him  Susan Collins 
10103,Not to the senate  I d wager   They gave him the green light back in February 
10104,As if this guy cared  The USA will have to vote him out in November  then carry him out  When the DEMS are in power  they better prosecute the whole corrupt administration of DT  starting with him to the full extent of the Law   If they do not do that  they are worse than him and set a dangerous precedent   NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW 
10105,Hey look  He s gone from extorting other countries to extorting our own country  It s a big step up  Best brains  Etc 
10106,Hasn t stopped him before  won t likely stop him now   He is above the law now and he knows it 
10107,Throw it on the pile  It goes to the moon now 
10108,Has it stopped him before 
10109,Great  Lets just add it to the unfathomably long list of crimes he ll never be accountable for 
10110,Not like that s stopped him before 
10111,It should be a federal crime to threaten to commit a federal crime 
10112,I mean  it s one of the reasons he was impeached   The fact that he got away with it is why we have to deal with this seemingly on a daily basis now 
10113,Since when do the Republicans even care about little things like  experts    the law  or  democracy   Let s face it  Republicans are going full on fascism 
10114,Oh  another crime no one will hold him accountable for   🙄
10115,Isn t it a crime to even suggest such a thing  Good lord this man is a joke 
10116,"Extortion doesn t even need to be carried out to be a crime  Simply making the threat is a felony 

 https   criminal findlaw com criminal charges extortion html  https   criminal findlaw com criminal charges extortion html "
10117,"The thing I find baffling is that Republicans actually want to keep doing this  Like they re fine with everyone being mad all the time and arguing about politics  Shit wasn t like this under Obama and outside of the War people were pretty civil during GWBs tenure


Like how the fuck do you want to keep living like this after the past three years "
10118,The senate will not care unfortunately 
10119,I can practically hear Republicans not giving a crap
10120,He commits federal crimes on a daily basis and no one stops him 
10121,Would the official tweet be Conspiracy to commit a crime 
10122,If only rule of law still existed
10123,Interfering with how the States hold their elections is a tyrannical violation of States  Rights  This tyranny 
10124,Not illegal if you own the cops 
10125,What  The same guy that threatened to commit war crimes against Iran has no problems commiting crimes against his own citizens 
10126,When has that ever stopped him 
10127,It s a crime to threaten someone with illegal actions for them doing something legal
10128,Add it to the pile 
10129,It would be more efficient to just tell us when something he does is  not  a crime  Crime is the default 
10130,Wouldn t be his first federal crime 
10131,Unless  of course  they tie it to some other bullshit that s entirely legal  Which is what they will do  This is just so the state knows why they re doing it  illegally  when they do it in a completely legal way 
10132,So  we put it on the pile of federal crimes he won t be held accountable to by the GOP 
10133,He can commit as many crimes as he wants since there is no accountability  The Senate Republicans already buried their heads in the sand and claimed they saw nothing 
10134,And he ll do it and face absolutely zero consequences
10135,Who is going to arrest him  There is no one left with the authority to enforce the law 
10136,Open coup in action   Blackmail to achieve it  in front of the world   Time to lock Trump up    Well past time  
10137,"The GOP gave him a  get out of jail card  and they ll do it again 

This isn t just about Trump  people  The GOP  the whole lot of them  are dismantling democracy  This isn t hyperbole  This isn t rhetoric  The GOP is killing the country in real time right before our eyes  There are NO innocent Republicans "
10138,Trump thinks that because rational people will be able to vote  he wouldn t stand a chance winning an election  And he s right  Him and the entire GOP will do anything to prevent rational people from voting    it s not in their best interest 
10139,"This president is above the law  So  I ask  so what  
How will this stuff ever stop if nobody is ever accountable "
10140,"There is crime in theory and crime in reality  In theory  violating federal law is a crime  In reality  there is no chance of being charged with a federal crime when your  fixer  is in charge of the DoJ  So it s like federal law doesn t exist 

Unless Trump loses the next election and there is a new head of DoJ  The GOP went  all in  on Trump  If he loses  there will be federal investigations galore  It s going to be popcorn time "
10141,Trump gives no fucks about the law
10142,Throw it in the pile  And don t even bother to sweep the pile under the rug 
10143,This mans entire career is a federal crime you think this ones gonna be the one to get him hit with something  Thats funny 
10144,Lmfao    like that has ever stopped him  
10145,Yea but the GOP will shrug and the Dems will write a sternly worded letter 
10146,Oh  like that means literally anything  There are no laws 
10147,Don t worry he ll get away with it 
10148,She should just call his bluff and sign the whole state up for mail in ballots
10149,He s learnt his lesson 
10150,Of course it would be  But he gets the headline 
10151,I m not trump knows what that means   violation of a federal law  
10152,Just throw it over there on the pile  then
10153,That s something Republicans don t care about
10154,Hey  doing those are his favorite 
10155,No one who is in a position to do anything  about it cares if Trump commits a crime 
10156,Oh no  not a federal crime 
10157,    and the Senate is complicit and nothing at all will be done 
10158,Laws are only as good as the will to enforce them 
10159,he should follow his own stupid logic and try to recoup funding from all the states that have used mail in for years   Oregon  the worst  screwing up their own elections for 20 years  get that money back  
10160,Recognize the usual trump ploy   threaten this week  and next week deny you ever said it 
10161,I m going to get conspiratorial here for a minute  I have no proof or inside knowledge off this  but it sure seems like right wing propeganda is aimed at making sure the virus spreads as much as possible while making sure trump supporters don t think it matters  I m sure it s not lost on propeganda pushers on the right that this will have an effect of suppressing voting on the left  This push to ban mail in ballots by the right seems to be specifically aimed at making sure this works 
10162,Cool story  I m sure the long flaccid arm of justice will do us right this time 
10163,When has that stopped him 
10164,  Cease quoting laws to us that have swords     Pompey the Great
10165,I m sure he got Barr on this already 
10166,So what  Don t waste legal experts time flogging a dead horse  You know nothing will ever come of it so don t waste any more time and money trying to pin shit on him that will never pass 
10167,Of course  by his own logic and the political reality right now  there is zero consequence for any breaking of laws for him or his administration 
10168,What are we gonna do    arrest him for breaking the law 
10169,"So sue me

 Trump"
10170, So what     GOP
10171,"Oh no  Not a federal crime 

 s"
10172,I had a terrible realization in bed awaiting sleep he is killing people and no body is doing anything about it so very Nazi of him 
10173,Very few things he s done is not a crime 
10174,With the senate in full control of the repubs    its not like trump will be censured for his abuses of power  the articles of impeachment lack teeth  without the senate  the process needs to change 
10175,There should be ZERO tolerance for this    The threat  should be treated the same as the crime 
10176,"So he would be    what    impeached over it 

🤦‍♂️"
10177,How is threatening to commit a crime not a crime in and of itself  
10178,In other words it s going to happen and nothing will happen as a result  Why is it so hard for people to get it into their heads that trump simply doesn t care if an action is legal or not 
10179,And  Laws only matter if there are consequences for breaking them  When has Trump ever faced any consequences 
10180,Hasn t stopped him yet 
10181,I can t wait for this to become a commercial used by Susan Collins  opponent followed by the video of her saying  I think he s learned his lesson  
10182,"Throw it on the pile 

He has been committing crimes whose penalties range from a  20 fine to the most serious penalty that the law can apply  openly  for years 

None of these crimes matter until someone is willing to prosecute him "
10183,"Cool  then the corrupt senate can forgive him 

This country is fucked "
10184,When has that stopped him  Like  seriously what the fuck can we do about it until after he s out of office  There is no accountability  The rule of law died when republicans voted against witnesses in a fucking impeachment trial  Why we didn t flip the fucking table and start guillotining these motherfuckers I ll never know 
10185,Trump   hold my hydroxychloroquine 
10186,who cares   its not like the dems are going to do anything about it 
10187,As if he goves a damn  
10188,That ll stop him
10189,But rehashing the 16 frightnight doesn t change we have a global disaster now and only getting worse This is what must be attended to 
10190,Why would the executive branch even be able to interfere with federal funds allotted to states in the first place  One would think that was entirely up to congress 
10191,And just whose gonna stop him  They gonna hold a gun to his head  Not sure even that would matter 
10192," Legal Experts Say Trump s Threat to Withhold Funding from Michigan Would Be a Federal Crime if Carried Out

I am sure that doubles the GOP resolve to carry this threat out  Trump cult is all about breaking the laws "
10193,It should be a crime to even imply it  It s still pressuring them to act a certain way
10194,Like anyone is actually going to do anything about it
10195,This Administration is breaking the law before our eyes  this would be more
10196,Just add it to the list   
10197,Isn t the threat of extortion an abuse of power 
10198,Uh huh  And   It s not like breaking the law has any meaning for him
10199,Sure  I bet that ll stick   s
10200,Like he s ever gonna get charged with anything
10201,The list of crimes continues to grow 
10202,Throw it on the pile
10203,Even if it s illegal we know that he ll get away with it just like everything else 
10204,The only republican in congress who isn t a complete piece of shit right now is Mitt Romney  He voted to impeach this president  and here he goes committing more impeachable offenses 
10205,Voting should not be a possible life or death choice for some  Let s leave it up to the states to handle it  like the Constitution states 
10206,Someone ask Susan Collins if he s learned his lesson yet
10207,So    can he please be removed from office for suggesting it  America  We d all appreciate that 
10208,Crimes are only illegal if Democrats do them 
10209,So  Trump never cared about those little inconveniences 
10210,"Legal experts say Trump s actions are a crime   No  487 in a series of 3000 

And nothing ever happens "
10211,He will carry it out and he will get away with it too because the republican party lets him 
10212,But there is no federal body that would charge or prosecute  so it s a moot point 
10213,"And yet   nobody will hold him accountable or tell him no  

Tell the Cheeto no "
10214,Aaand he hasn t already committed a federal crime at least once 
10215,Toss in on the pile 
10216,"Umm did they forget the precedent set when he was acquitted for  just doing what was best for his re election  how s this any different  It s not  And there s not shit we can do about it until November 

Vote "
10217,"Well yea  It doesn t matter  Trump can commit any crime he wants too  As long as there s a republican controlled senate Trump can do say whatever he wants  

Only thing I can do short of an armed uprising is vote "
10218,Back in my day a threat made by an elected president towards his citizens that dismantles their democratic republic was illegal 
10219,How many laws has he broken to date   Is he still in office 
10220,With this senate he can do anything 
10221,Fuck it  Throw it on the pile 
10222,The people of Michigan need to bring a class action lawsuit against Trump
10223,So what  He is basically immune to everything by now 
10224,And 
10225,They make it sound like Trump isnt above the law 
10226,Just add it to the list 
10227,"I feel like every week I come here and see  Legal Experts Say Trump s               Would Be a Federal Crime if Carried Out 

Nothing ever happens  Stories like this are just go nowhere bullshit 

It s depressing "
10228,Isn t the threat itself evidence of conspiracy to commit the crime 
10229,Response from White House      and  
10230,Sooo business as usual for Trump since breaking federal laws are a daily occurrence in the Administration   Gotcha
10231,"Hard to believe blue states continued receiving any federal support after the 2018 mid terms 

Gotta get those voters in line some how "
10232,So what if it s a federal crime  that doesn t stop Trump  especially since the no backbone republicans and Toadybarr will rubber support whatever he does  The rule of law is meaningless
10233,God I ve become complacent to this   The guy is not wrong  he can literally do anything he wants   No one is going to stop him   That s the world we live in now   Fucking depressing to see his face anymore 
10234,"This is all just distraction to move the conversation away from the firing of the State Department IG and the oversight of the DOT 

Of course he couldn t actually withhold funds like this  He doesn t even believe he could  he s already lost in court over similar things  

Ignore this and keep the pressure up in the oversight issues "
10235,So what if it s a federal crime

The media is embarrassing as trump completely continues to own the messaging "

10240,It may be a crime but the feds do not care 
10241,I m sure he s shaking in his three inch heels 
10242,The entire idea of withholding funding from a state for any reason is ridiculous  It s unamerican  The entire idea of is being  united  in the United States is being challenged by this fucking idiot in the White House 
10243,It s frustrating that these reports exist and nothing will happen regardless of what he does  He s already done illegal things and hasn t faced any repercussions  why would it start now 
10244,you mean grounds for impeachment  haha
10245,And if it s carried out nothing will happen just like all the other crimes being committed in plain site that no one who can give a shit about will give a shit about  Muricuh
10246,And so  The perceived checks and balances on a president aren t there and never existed 
10247,Please do it so we can finally end this administration  Pleeeease    
10248,And what the fuck is going to be done about it  Oh yeah  absolutely nothing 
10249,Quid pro quo  It s how he rolls

10259,Sure it s a federal crime  but it s going to have to grind through the courts and won t stop until trump s supreme court weighs in on it   After all  it s only a crime if you get convicted and when you ve stuffed the courts and the police with your cronies who s going to worry  Not trump  that s for sure 
10260,Who cares  Almighty overlord trump is above the law 
10261,Wow it s almost like people think the executive branch is forced to comply with the law or something
10262,Someone should tell him that  I bet he d stop immediately and be so embarrassed  Poor guy

Trouble is  he doesn t care  and no one stops him or enforces any consequences  so I m willing to bet he ll still try "
10269,We should host a new TV show called Wheel of Crime in which every day Trump spin the wheel but both the audience and the host are absent so contestant Trump can declare victory each time

10278,"Well  in that case he could be investigated  tried  and imprisoned    oh  wait  there are no consequences anymore  He can admit to the crime  then say  No  you can t investigate it  because it might distract me from doing more crimes    then his buddies in the Senate will back him on it and it won t matter 

But Susan Collins assured us that he learned his lesson "
10279,Does it really matter  He ll get away with it in the end 
10280,"big fuckin deal  i ve lost all faith in the government s will and ability to do anything about it   it wouldn t be the first felony he s committed while in office and it won t be the last but he has already proven that doesn t matter when there s no one left to actually hold him accountable 

i swear every time i see a new  experts say this thing Trump did says he will do is illegal  i just think      yea  so what  in addition to the countless other illegal things he s done  

so fucking depressing"
10281,Yes  it would be illegal   But it s worse than that   Withholding funds from a state ravaged by a pandemic   In order to secure further power   So he can further forestall prosecution while he hides behind the shield of his office   Doing this would transcend questions of legality   It would be a declaration of war against the populace he was elected to serve 
10282,Like that fucking matters anymore

We know Barr won t prosecute the President and the Senate won t convict him   But if it is a crime in Michigan  they can try him in the courts there "
10290,I m afraid we are way past the point that he even cares  Neither do any of his GOP buddies he s gotten away with so much what s another federal offense  With Mitch on his side he could shoot someone in Time Square and walk away  Who s gonna stop him 
10291,Dummies  The president can t break the law 
10292,Pretty sure that isn t going to stop him 
10293,this is what happens when Moscow Mitch lets POTUS do anything he wants
10294,Oh no a crime  He cant get away with a crime guys    same shit different day  Nothing will happen to this ass clown 
10295,Well  the President is above the law  so there s that 
10296,he dont give a fuck bro
10297,According to r Politics  just Trump breathing is a federal crime 
10298,Yes  it s called extortion 
10299,I ve heard when the president does it  it s not a crime  🙄
10300,Almost sounds like bribery
10301,That is why Moscow Mitch need to fill up those judge seat as soon as possible  You can t be charged if no court is going to take the case 
10302,If you re President  No  Fascism 101   
10303,Like a reverse quid pro quo 
10304,Sad how trump can commit any crime he wants but no one will prosecute him
10305,This is my first thought as well  Threatening to commit a crime in order to get a response that the threatened party did not want to perform 
10306,Doesn t matter  Nobody will stop him 
10307,"He won t be prosecuted  

That said  there s nothing stopping Biden and the Lincoln project from making a bunch of  ads   where it s essentially just him saying it  Probably play well in Michigan "
10308,Didn t Trump shit all over that excuse  and her making it  like a day after she said it  Might have been even less time than that 
10309,ok   so who enforces this crime   we are not left with any checks and balances and trump knows this 
10310, Nice law you got there    It would be a shame if    someone failed to enforce any of it 
10311,What do you do to a rabid animal 
10312,45 s counsel put forth the argument during the impeachment hearings that the executive can do anything they want as long as they believe it s in the best interest of the country  As long as the GOP goes along with that premise  the only lesson for 45 is that he can do whatever he wants without being held accountable 
10313,"At this point we just need to keep track of it and bring it once he s out of office  We know the cult won t do shit about it  He s broken so many laws and fucked the whole country while looting and siphoning money to his businesses  

I m to the point of almost being numb to it  REpubs are not going to hold him accountable and dems are going to go softly at him with the hopes of bipartisan support  

When this is all over I hope every democrat in congress tells the republicans to fuck off  when the republicans use the line of   We need to heal  and letting this slide is the best way to heal  we know they would never do this if the shoe was on the other foot "
10314,Fuck Susan Collins 
10315,I just watched the movie Vice and according to Dick Cheney  and going by the history since the 2000 elections  a sitting President has the power to do whatever he got damn pleases 
10316,No  he absolutely learned his lesson  the GOP will  never  hold him responsible or try to stop him in any way 
10317,"He has been doing this with PPE to Blue states  If they didn t do anything for that  they won t do anything for this  

We can talk about the consequences  and the law  but no one is being held accountable  so it s just talk  

We need to stop pretending  and screwing around  This isn t anything new  It s a pattern  Stop acting shocked  and pretending like anything really stands in his way  Is it not clear he s off his rocker "
10318,"We ve been told this is illegal  that s illegal  this is totally illegal and it makes zero difference  The republicans will go to bat for this corrupt moron  So get the fuck out there America and vote 

Sincerely 
The world"
10319,But Barr says Trump can do anything he wants and it s being proven over and again to be true  I liked it better when we had a system of checks and balances 
10320,"  I m not sure he really learned his lesson    

Of course he did  He learned a very valuable lesson  

He learned that he is completely immune and protected from any consequences by the Republican held DOJ and Senate "
10321,Trump did learn his lesson  that he could do anything he wants  with impunity  as long as Republicans control the Senate and roll over 
10322,Sure he learned his lesson  Got away with it once  can do it again 
10323,He did learn his lesson    that it s apparently OK to extort as president
10324,No  he learned his lesson   Look at how brazen he is with his actions   Firing 4 IGs in a few weeks  openly threatening states      
10325,He did learn his lesson  The lesson he learned is that if he is President he can extort all he wants and no one will stop him  Seems like he learned his lesson perfectly 
10326,So much for America first  even Ukraine gets a look in before us 
10327,You re wrong     The president did learn his lesson  That lesson being he can do anything he wants with zero repercussions 
10328,It WaS aSpIrAtIoNaL 
10329,now ask pelosi if she is going to hold trump accountable instead of passing all his signature legislation unhindered because she s to busy blocking progressive additions that will help the average american in her bills that funnel money to lobbyists and insurance companies making record profits 
10330," one of the legal scholars

Adam Schiff  pretty sure he predicted this almost to the letter "
10331,"  good thing those slaps on the wrist worked

when did he get a slap on the wrist  yes he was impeached  big deal  since he wasn t removed  there were no consequences  it s just like his life pre 2016   he does something wrong and gets away with it 

my only hope is that he will be charged once he leaves office  since he seems to have  temporary   or  absolute   i forget which one they are claiming now     immunity from prosecution  shit has to catch up with him and his family eventually "
10332,Yes  this is exactly what he was impeached for  And just like the last time  my mother  with 2 BAs  will say  That s not what he meant  unironically  3 minutes after she tells me for the 10 000th time that  she likes him because he tells it like it is    Queue  donning her MAGA hat 
10333,It seems to even an untrained eye as if that law has already been violated by this administration several times 
10334,You haven t heard  The president can do anything he wants 
10335,"Problem is that it turns out laws are only as good as people willing to uphold them  

We need an independent DOJ  An independently elected AG not beholden to the POTUS"
10336,He had his fingers crossed and nobody said  pinky swear  
10337,He also took a vow to be faithful to his many wives  but that didn t stop him from barebacking porn stars 
10338,While he s accusing someone or something of voter fraud  what he means to accuse them of is actually    election fraud     which in fact    is what he is committing   with his threat and accusation 
10339,Funny how he s not aiming the same threat at Oregon and Washington  who are 100  vote by mail 
10340,He also said he was going to be the  law and order  president 
10341,Yea but hasn t actually done that since literally the moment he was sworn in  So 
10342,Republicans take an oaf of office
10343,No he took an oath to uphold how he interprets the law duh
10344,Sure he took an oath  but we might have taken a cue on his trustworthiness the day after his inauguration when falsely claiming it was the biggest crowd ever  Or every other crap that came out of his mouth eversince 
10345," The president is acting in the interests of the country in an effort to preserve election security  

  Fox"
10346,He had his fingers crossed so it doesn t count  No take backs 
10347,His definition of the word faithful isn t really the same as the rest of us
10348,"People will be quick to dogpile on you and take the piss because you re  being defeatist  but it s fucking  true  

The mother fucker has gotten away with  e v e r y t h i n g    Even the few people who got put in jail are now walking fucking FREE "
10349,"And  we ve bought into the bullshit cycle again   


   Trump tweets something outlandish and likely illegal   
   News breathlessly reports all over it   
   Legal experts weigh on how it s illegal  and the President shouldn t do it   
   Trump waits a few days  tweets on it again   
   Rinse  repeat   


Meanwhile  Trump is firing the Inspectors General that were investigating corrupt republicans  and McConnell is installing unqualified judges for lifetime appointments "
10350,This   
10351,Exactly this  Trump is not the problem     an entire army of moronic politicians  officials and business leaders who keep propping him up and supporting him are the real problem 
10352,my first thought as well 
10353,Yes  Because a majority of the Senate are traitors 
10354,Add it to the huge existing pile of federal crimes and onto the next one 
10355,i can t wait for a Democratic president who uses those lines  i don t think it will happen but god i would love to have one do it and see the Republican s heads explode 
10356,Ding ding ding  We have a winner  This is why the impeachment was such a big deal  It wasn t about the crimes  which he most certainly committed  it was about precedent  And now the precedent has been set that if the president believes that their re election is in the best interest of the country  then they can do whatever they want to ensure their re election
10357,Lots of people care  Just not the republicans who have the power to do something about it 
10358,But then they wouldn t get money and nothing would happen to Trump bc the entire GOP is corrupt too
10359,"A federal crime that he ll likely not get charged with because he s stacked the fucking deck  

I ll keep the absentee voting and make sure we can vote his ass out in November "
10360,So  that s  what Space Force is for 
10361,The lesson being he can do whatever he wants and Republicans will do everything they can to protect him  I m convinced Trump could have a sitting Republican senator jailed and the rest of them would continue defending him 
10362,"How about the federal crime of deleting the tweet 
That s an open an shut case "
10363,Explain Obamagate  then 
10364,"Are you implying that you don t give a shit about his crimes  or that there are none 

Bonus points if you don t change the subject "
10365,Do we really need to point to the laws stating that withholding federal funds to states is a crime 
10366," just Trump breathing is a federal crime 

No   Fortunately  that s a state level misdemeanor   He can t be pardoned for it   The fat baby should have worn a mask   Maybe he ll realize that after a few days in jail 

And then we can deal with the fact that he is using MY federal dollars to extort states   Probably going to spend a little more time in jail for  ya know  treason "
10367,What crime should I be charged with for mail in voting 
10368,It s true  this is the place for the trump hate circle jerk  Everything is a crime and impeachable for him here 
10369,Add it to the list I guess 
10370,Seems trump hasn t learned a thing  I hope Susan Collins is sitting down due to the shock 
10371,It was a perfect extortion  There was nothing wrong about it 
10372,It s also a quid pro quo  The same thing he was impeached for minus it involving foerign aid and for a political favor  In this case  it s domestic aid and in exchange he wants no mail in ballots  Well  I guess the next Democrat President can start demanding red states to do as he pleases or else he will deny aid 
10373,It s like blackmail  but the x makes it sound cool 
10374,The x makes it cool 
10375,It s the  best  notcrime 
10376,The threat makes it extortion  In this case  the threat of withholding funding 
10377,A little quid pro quo amirite 
10378,This actually is a quid pro quo  Essentially he s saying if you want state funds  you must not offer mail in ballots

It s blatantly obvious nobody in government will   or can   hold him responsible

10383,well  in theory it would start with the dem controlled lower house led by pelosi  but she s shown she isn t actually interested in holding him accountable 
10384,Staple it to your scalp  then become the worst President in US history 
10385,Make it President apparently
10386,And what s best for 45 is in the best interests of the country   Donald Trump and all his collaborators 
10387,Yet that same standard of course doesn t apply to the previous president   after all  he was  presidenting while black    a major sin in the view of the GOP

Alan Dershowitz  the piece of shit kiddie fucker compatriot of Trump and Epstein  is the one that made this particular garbage argument "
10389,I wouldn t fuck Susan Collins with   your   dick 
10390,Yup  That film was actually very insightful to me for learning about not only the  unitary executive  legal philosophy Barr subscribes to  but also the loosening of the regulations that allowed Fox News to develop as a Propaganda network in the 90s  Dick Cheney was at the heart of it all  Barr is just following in his footsteps to execute the plan they started during the Nixon Administration  😖
10391,He was impeached  Certain senators like Collins said things like  it s embarrassing to be impeached  that s punishment enough  he s learned his lesson   The typical bullshit people say when they are disregarding constitutional law and convention 
10392,Don t hold your breath
10393,2 BAs  U sure it wasn t 2 BSs 
10394,To add on  apparently the president is too busy to have any oversight over them because that will interfere with presidential duties

Would you rather that the News is not reported 

Would you rather not know that legal experts think it s breaking the law 

Yes the GOP is corrupt in that they won t restrain Trump  Yes the legal system is hampered by a corrupt head of the DOJ  Yes McConnell is busy installing unqualified judges  likely so earnestly because he expects that there s a good chance the the GOP is going to lose both the Senate and Presidency in November

  It was a perfect call   Trump added  an apparent reference to his July 25 conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which he pushed the leader to announce investigations into his political opponents  Trump and his allies have repeatedly argued that his conversations with Zelensky were  perfect  

I could swear he said some other things  but I don t have time to skim through all of the articles  This is the gist though "

Unironically  yes  We could even create a House Committee for it just like they did during the Cold War with the House Unamerican Activities Committee  Assign some Representatives to that committee and every time Trump commits something that might be an impeachable offense  have them do a brief investigation  announce the finding  hold a vote in the House  send the articles to the Senate  Using this method  they can send an infinite number of articles to the Senate and keep doing their daily business  The huge benefit to this is that it keeps McConnell and co  busy constantly crying about how unfair everything is and  perhaps more importantly  it keeps Roberts from fucking things up too much in the Supreme Court because his fat ass has to preside over any proceedings in the Senate "

That somewhat plays into Trump s  create yet another distraction  modus operandi 

They have all of that reporting in the archives  I d expect to see a lot more historical recaps of Trump s Presidency as we get closer to November 

I ve been keeping an evernote folder for political events full of links to news articles of the day and tags for people categories  I m thinking about taking the tags and making an historical graph from them  For example Anthony Fauci has only popped up once in the news in the last week  and that was from protestors putting up a  Hang Fauci  sign "

To put it another way  the winners of those elections are not  whomever has the most votes out of 100    The winners are  in fact   whomever has the most votes of the members of their respective parties     That means that McConnell only needs  in the current Senate  27 Senators to vote for him   Not 51 "
10467,"  Are you sure about that 

Yes   Emphasis mine 

 The Senate Republican and Democratic floor leaders are elected   by the members of their party   in the Senate at the beginning of each Congress  Depending on which party is in power  one serves as majority leader and the other as minority leader

These  Parties  are private organizations that coordinate fundraising and policy goals amongst their members

If a Republican Senator decides that they no longer want to be a member of the Senate Republican Conference  they are free to decide to join the Senate Democratic Caucus  If the Senate Democratic Caucus finds itself with more members  they vote on their own Majority Leader 

This has nothing to do with their membership in the political parties at large  just their role in the Senate "

10481,The blowjob was just an excuse too  They are fine with doing all sorts of sexual things  legal and illegal  in private  They just have to appear to care about it for their base

10483,"They didnt find shit with whitewater  they just kept the investigation going untio they found an embarrassing extramarital affair on par with jfk  lbj  fdr  Not to mention the gop speaker of the house was cheating on hisncancer stricken wife as well  That s been going on in dc for centuries   Thomas Jefferson was having sex with a 14 year old slave girl he owned  and having kids with her  It s the first time they actually used it as grounds to try to impeach a president over 

Dad said in government on the civilian level  cheating on your wife is an unbecoming personal quality  but it doesn t establish that your incapable of doing your federal job 

That s how he said it  and why what the Republicans were doing was a textbook definition witch hunt  once Gingrich became speaker it set the US on a course of bitter hateful partisanship that would divide the nation forever   although imo Reagan helped get the ball rolling  and that snot nosed racist twat Lee Atwater 

Edit  Whitewater not watergate"
10484,"  sexual relations  was explicitly defined as vaginal intercourse  

That s not true  It was defined as  contact with the genitalia  anus  groin  breast  inner thigh  or buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person   It included a wide range of activities  Clinton argued that his actions did not fit this definition  The most prominent example was a blowjob which did not involve HIM contacting any of those body parts  but Lewinsky did  so she probably had sexual relations with him without him having sexual relations with her   and I guess any contact he did have with those body parts wasn t with the intent of arousing or gratifying anyone s sexual desires "
10485,I just had a funny thought  During the Clinton years  the nation was trying to figure out what  the definition of is is   We hung on those words to that extent  Now with Trump  words seem to have no meaning at all  He barfs out word salad all day every day  It s beyond any analysis  much less the extreme hyperanalysis that Clinton got  Fun times  Fun times 
10486,"Membership in a specific party s caucus conference is open only to  a  members of that party  and  b  independent members    Members of the opposing party are not eligible 

  If a Republican Senator decides that they no longer want to be a member of the Senate Republican Conference  they are free to decide to join the Senate Democratic Caucus  

No   No  they aren t   They can leave the Republican party  declare Independent  and join the Democratic Caucus   They can leave the Republican party  declare Democratic  and join the Democratic Caucus   What they   can t   do is retain the  R  next to their name and join the Democratic Caucus "
10487,"  if GOP senators decided to vote him out in favor of someone else alone with the dem votes  there is nothing to prevent it 

Other than the Democrats not getting a vote in the Majority Leader election   There are no  dem votes  in the Republican Conference leadership election   That s not a thing 

All of the Senators with an  R  next to their name  as well as any Independents who choose to conference with them  get together and vote on the Majority Leader    There are no Democrats in the room  because they don t get to vote in elections for the opposing party s leadership 

Think about it  If members of one party was permitted to vote in the leadership elections of the other party  then the current Majority Leader would be McConnell  and the the Minority Leader would be whomever is the  least  effective Democrat in the Senate   Fuck  it might even be a Republican "
10488,Which is funny because their base only appears to care about it so their horse sits a little higher
10489,"Pretty much  they blew up at Obama wearing a jacket and using Dejan mustard  Clinton s impeachment was literally just not being forthcoming about a truth  not even about the act of the truth  I believe we can go back to every democratic president and find some crazy way they try and try 

I mean the most hilarious is AOC a rise to power and fame    they found a college dancing video  Like the young man I am  I m like oh yeah  this gonna be half naked or full nude  booze  coke    wait a minute this is like some Art class style video    this is THE most incriminating thing you dug up with your billions   Y all white  insecure dudes are in trouble "
