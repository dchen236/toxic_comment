10495,Damn  even the memes are getting quarantined   
10496,Thank you  We really need a break and some wholesome memes during these days
10497,Thank you  I go on r wholesomememes to try and escape the fears of modern day life  and seeing Covid 19 Memes are unhelpful and scary 
10498,I m glad I need a break from them 
10499,Thank you so much  Just seeing too much stuff about the virus gives me a panic attack
10500,Thank you so much  Very helpful  We just need a mental health break so badly  Thank you for creating a space for that 
10501,Stay safe people
10502,My anxiety has been so high because all I see and read is Coronavirus related  Finally a place to get away from it 🙏
10503,Thank I really appreciate it I m tired of seeing shitty coronavirus memes
10504,thank god love this sub
10505,"If anyone reading this has anyone in their family over 60  call them  not now  wait until they are awake    Talk to them   Ask them everything you wanted to know about them   Ask them how their day was   Tell them you are there for them if they need anything 

Oh and if they are worried about Coronavirus tell them to wash their hands and don t touch their face   "
10506,Heavenly
10507,Thank you
10508,Thank you for this 
10509,THANK YOU 🙏
10510,Agggh thanks you guys   a lot of us really needed a break
10511,Thank you  I need a break from it 
10512,I wish other meme subreddits did this  I m sick of coronavirus memes
10513,Wait  r news jealously provided this news  
10514,Thank you  I literally just popped over here in an attempt to get away from them  My heart rate can t take it anymore 
10515,oH nO bEeR vIrUs
10516,I wanted to feel a bit better about the crisis and was curious to see how r wholesomememes would handle this and help me see the bright side of things  I get it  but finding out they ve decided to just ignore it is a bit disappointing 
10517, deleted 
10518,Because coronavirus isn t a wholesome thing to have 
10519,How do you post plz I need help
10520,Thank you 
10521,Thank you
10522,Thank you so much  Had a minor panic attack just now after bombardment of US  press briefs  and reading worldnews  politics  etc   came here for a reset and am not disappointed 
10523,I m really on here just to feel better  I don t need COVID stress while I m trying to feel wholesome 
10524,It s appropriate to ban the memes on a wholesome memes website  It isn t necessary for you to present a lecture on Covid   which people going on  wholesome memes site probably want a break from anyway 
10525,Really good choice  I ve become even more depressed while stuck indoors since I moved to a French part of Canada and I ve been struggling to make friends  and the fact that I m stuck indoors doesn t help  Coronavirus memes remind me about reality and the only reason I m in  r WholesomeMemes is for the sake of forgetting about reality  Stay safe and wash your hands everyone 
10526,Thank you so much for creating and truly enforcing this temporary rule  It might seem silly to some  but honestly after seeing virus related things all day everywhere else  it s good to have one spot where I know I won t be bombarded with anything like that  Wholesome or not  some of us are very grateful to have one place where we can try to pretend everything is normal  ♥️
10527,Thank god if i have to see anything else related to corona im gonna throw up    enough already    fuck  
10528,Can I like things more than once
10529,Thank you so much
10530,Gg
10531,More wholesomeness
10532,Aw man  I thought mine was wholesome and didn t talk about it much 
10533,yay no depressing topics   ill go now
10534, platinum 
10535,Great call   Thank you 
10536,I like this idea  I know that I ve gotten overwhelmed with COVID 19 posts to the point of having to take a break from social media  Plenty of it was funny  but some of it was ignorant or hurtful  It s nice to be able to go to a page where I can take a break from all that 
10537,Yes no more of those unoriginal memes
10538,Generously
10539,Why can t I comment
10540,Your post   with all this Covid 19 info   was posted 45 days ago  It s outdated and now misleading 
10541,Wow quarantine for memes
10542,Ok
10543, r
10544,Good idea  Hope you re all keeping safe 
10545,There are no longer 69 comments here  im haha funny
10546,Thanks to this I m writing an article on how to get your mind away from current events  for my school newspaper  and I m using this subreddit as my first example 
10547,K
10548,can we also ban  the  showering you with love and affection  memes as well  theyre also unoriginal
10549,Everything has a time   There are things to make fun with and some should not be  Thank you for having a heart on this issue  🙏🏼💯 Since yesterday tha I ve found this page  aww I can t get enough reading posts here  This is the only page that has humor or funny yet the heart and caring are stay  Keep it up  You are helping the cyber world to be more less polluted  😇
10550,thank you  60  of literally every subreddit is about the virus  It s nice to take a break from it 
10551, Everyone liked that  meme
10552,ok
10553,Virus memes shouldn t have been allowed in the first place
10554,Hhh me too
10555,Thank you  You stay safe  too 
10556,So is this switching from Wholesome Memes bans Covid memes but it s ok we can still do Covid satire in the comments  Is it useful to have a DarkHumorOnCovid 19 subreddit 
10557,Good idea 
10558,I m guessing it s a typo  Probably meant to be  generously  
10559,I agree
10560,Maybe start off with some posts yourself  It s sad and empty there    
10561,I ll remove the info  Thanks 
10562,That s awesome  Make sure to let me know when it s done  I d love to read it

10583,Often  it s a long story  means  i don t want to tell you  in which case I m all ears isn t super wholesome 
10584,Yeah big missed opportunity
10585,Are you not familiar with the phrase  I m all ears  
10586,It was a loose reference to Guardians of the Galaxy  too loose I guess  my bad
10587,Glad I asked  then  I haven t dived into the MCU all that much 
10588,My wife s and my chat history has just become a string of cute animal gifs we ve been sending each other working across the room from each other

10592,Totally haven t spammed my boyfriend with memes for 20 minutes because he wasn t answering me and I m in need of attention and I want to love him
10593,Gifs are my main love language 
10594,Me and my gf just send each other memes all the time
10595,"1  most people

10598,u RainebowEvee how I feel every time you ask me what I had for dinner

10601,Man both ain t working need some other one to transfer my idea 
10602,bro this is literally me
10603,The second one is literally me 
10604,if you sent me 100 memes and gifs at the same time i might block you

10606,1 is my boyfriend  2 is me lmao

10612,Here are a one hundred memes
10613,Both is good 
10614,I swear  if I get a gf  she d better prepare her inbox for a flood of adorable animal gifs and pics   So many puppies and kittens   I m the sort of guy who will be across the globe in an exotic city  and get excited because someone has a dog nearby 
10615,My bf is so mad that I want to show him all the things  so I try not to  but he doesn t get it 😔 If I try he takes my phone lmao
10616,I send memes about like  40K or DnD and my partner always appreciates them  even if she doesnt always understand them straight away yknow

10619,"I think it s a strong sign of love when you see something funny or cool  and there s someone you think of IMMEDIATELY that you HAVE to share it with  

It s not necessarily a romantic love  I love my friends  I love my wife  It s different love  but love all the same "
10620,My crush really likes memes so i send her like 30 memes every day
10621, is your brain being nice to you 
10622, Is your brain being nice to you today  would probably be the most warm and considerate thing anyone could ask me 
10623,Simp
10624,I am thinking that for our 20 year anniversary I am going to print and bind our entire text history   The gifs won t work so well  but it should be really fun 
10625,I m glad I m not the only one who noticed that 
10626,Its been so long
10627,It s not 2011 anymore  memes become outdated in less than a week  Keeping thousands of old memes in folders is fine for a meme historian  but they re no good for sending to anyone without embarrassing yourself 
10628,Are you sure it is just memes 
10629,But  welcome to reddit  I d be happy to teach you memes any time 🙂
10630,Can I have memes 👉🏼👈🏼

10644,To this monster
10645,Sorry  thought it would be obvious that a comment involving  meme historians  and talking about memes like they re serious business is actually not meant to be taken seriously 
10646,Rightyyo  have a nice day evening 
10647,Yæ where do I get memes

10717,My cats great me every single time I come home  Maybe try building a better bond through playing and trying to teach the kitty some tricks  It s hilarious to teach cats tricks as they prefer to just try to grab the treats  so it s extra awesome when they do the trick

10794,"My friend Derek popped up recently drunk and unannounced on my whatsapp after months 

Guy s been helping me cope with a lot atm  including my ex  who he knows  using and abusing me "
10795,Seeing this meme inspired me to contact old friends  I m currently in 5 conversations with people I d lost touch with 
10796,Started singing in my head at the start for some reason
10797,holt some
10798,I haven t heard from one of my friends in awhile her stepdad was an alcoholic and abused her and her brothers she had her phone taken away for a year I haven t heard from her since I hope she s ok now I m getting emotional now talking about this
10799,I wish    That shit never happens to me AND I recently lost all of them   
10800,Lmfao mans really couldn t be a surprise lol

10803,Take your time
10804,This definitely isn t me 
10805,Jeez    It should be a surprise lol
10806,More like  ugggh now I feel obligated to respond and might end up having to carry out a conversation  This is exhausting please leave me alone  But I don t want to be rude so I give the easiest shortest replies and have to feign interest for 5 mins  
10807,It s so nice to see a dermatologist 
10808,I m broke and he just asked me a dollar i borrowed compound interested at 100  per day

10827,"You guys have friends  I am just sitting here in my room building Gunpla by myself and being a sad lonely introvert

10828,I think this meme was supposed to be sarcastic

10830,I got what 
10831,It s not MLM  It s a Network generating strategy using limited one to one marketing with binary system 
10832,Can people here help me out  PLEASE  There are old friends I would love to reach out to  but I have no idea what to talk about     What do you do when you reach out to people with whom you have not talked to in a long time  Thanks  
10833, It s not a surprise to no one 
10834,Havent had a friend hit me up in over 3 years  depression and isolation can be a bih  but hey i guess thats how the story goes for some of uss ❤️

10836,"When you had a bad day    

And your gf breaks up with you  

I m too tried and sad to be sad and cry "
10837,I had a bad day yesterday and was about to go to class when an old friend that i rarely talk to came to me and told me that he was getting a buzzcut  i have a buzzcut and that made my day 
10838,This sub has lost its way 
10839,This sub is literally the worst on Reddit 😩👌🏻🤪
10840,"Almost the same thing happened to me  The girl and I go back seven years all the way from xbox 360 classic minecraft  

Then one day we stopped talking  life went on  and every now and again she d pop up to me and we d talk for a week then she would dip out again  and the cycle repeated  Most of the time it was like she had a 6th sence cause she would always pop up when I was angry upset sad about something and would just talk to me without prying 

 Along the way I developed a major crush on her and couldn t say anything  The last month she popped up again and added me on SC and we ve been talking ever since and now I just need to work up the guts to ask if she wants to meet up "
10841,rocket league can become super intense  same thing happened to me  Lost all my friends bc I was grinding all day everyday  didn t have the time to keep up with anyone
10842,Oh damn  I didn t even notice that this wasn t the B99 sub 
10843,Hello  how are you 
10844,Hello again  hello  Just called to say  hello   I couldn t sleep at all tonight and I know it s late  but I couldn t wait 
10845,You got anyone you can be that friend to  Just as gratifying
10846,It s better like that if the person that does it is your old best friend that left you for your crush after she got mad on you because of him
10847,I ve been thinking of doing that to some friends  but was afraid they d find it weird   
10848,I ll be a good friend to you then
10849,I ve found that people will start reaching out to you if you reach out to them first  The honest truth is that people tend to stop thinking about people who aren t involved in their lives  but if you reach out to them you ll be on their radar and they ll hopefully start reaching out to you  Obviously its not a 100  return rate but you d be surprised at how many people will text you first and invite you to things if you just make an effort keep in touch with them  Someone has to make the first move why not you  I think the amount of work that goes into maintaining friendships with people you don t see on a daily basis is really understated 
10850,My own best friend barely responds to me now lmao
10851,"Someone actually did it to me last month and it really did lift my spirits for like a week 

Then I found out the friend had texted my boyfriend about something technical first  and he suggested she text me to check in  So it wasn t actually a lovely  spontaneous showcase of friendship 

I guess I should be happy I have a bf that cares enough to get my friends to pretend they like me but it doesn t really feel the same  you know "

10875,Do it  Worst case scenario she says no  but you won t stop thinking about what could have happened if you don t 
10876,I was in a similar boat a while ago  ask her  I let it eat at me for years and eventually some other guy with a lesbian haircut took her  I did eventually tell her to get that weight off my back and that didn t really do much  However  about 4 months later I met the most amazing girl I ve ever met  Very white  dark brown hair  and those kind of eyes that are green towards the outside of the irises and gradually become blue in the middle  We agree on just about everything with only a few differences  but hey if we agreed on everything it d get a little boring  After knowing her for a month and a half I stsrted dating her  never been happier  Haven t even thought about my crush on the first girl until I read this thread  even though we re still good friends  Don t wait man  you re the motherfucking CanadianScotsman  Get that shit over with  If it doesn t work out then fuck it  wasn t going anywhere anyway and if it does then you re a happy man  Good luck on your endeavors and have a good day 
10877,"Do it  The only thing you ll regret is not doing anything at all  You ll look back and wonder what could have been

10887,Well i do and i have tried for a long time  It doesnt work like that for me   I have very few things in common with people  i have very shit humor  no other connections to other people  like hobbies  
10888,Focus more on that boyfriend part 
10889,At least she cared  As someone socially maladjusted  I am sure their heart was in the right place

10891,Boom boom  Jake 
10892,Terry mincing while shouting  One two twoOoOo   is like the second most negative thing I ve ever seen him do 
10893,Good point  Ngl it s weighing on my mind a bit but i need not to think too deeply into it 
10894,Would have almost preferred no reply  The response I got was just dismissive 
10895,Thanks mate
10896,You have earned the title of Boss Man u AbsoluteChad   That was one of the most motivating comments I ve seen on this site 
10897,Should i call or text her to let her know  Ive been texting and snapping here and there for the past couple months

And I can t commiserate with anyone because my pain isn t as bad as someone else s so no one cares 

Thanks "
10909,Yeah it s when Amy shows him the precinct numbers and assures him that he s doing a good job

10932,Poor guys who worked out really hard
10933,I was trying to figure out why the second picture showed a guy hitting himself in the face with his giant dick and then I realized that it s a rock 
10934, Wow you are so strong     heyiambee
10935,Yeaaaaa  that s not me
10936,JudgeZZZ
10937,Wholesome meme of the week  3
10938,Idk why but it sucks  like someone like me who doesn t open a lot to people becomes weak  Someone who doesn t want to display his true feelings doesn t become weak
10939,Every time I see this posted  I wonder what the judges are doing  The point of a strength contest is that strength can be objectively measured by how heavy of a rock you can lift  There s literally no reason for the judges to be there 
10940,How about the power   to move you 
10941,This hits harder than that time I drank everclear before a church dinner  
10942,Low brightness much appreciated
10943, I just feel like she doesn t listen to me the same way she used to     Eddie Hall
10944,But what about people that don t open up to others in order to not be a burden on other people and to be the person to lift the spirits of others 
10945,I did this and now I m having a hard time
10946,Fuck yeah Neville Longbottom 
10947,Sounds like something weaklings would say
10948,Why does the strongman competition have bodybuilder judges  Sorry its bothering me
10949,I m I wierd if I like beastars
10950,r egg irl  
10951,Aww thanks
10952,Indeed
10953,He s just rock hard
10954,His wife must be lucky 
10955, 3 thx
10956,No  If you open up or don t it doesn t mean you re weak  If u open up you re stronger and u got over your feelings  if u don t open up u still haven t  getting over some feelings  it s very tough so don t knock yourself over for that
10957,"If you aren t able to communicate with honesty and you don t want to share your thoughts  desires  and dreams  then you re weak  You don t need to tell everyone everything  but if you re withholding crucial information due to insecurities and fear  then you re hurting everyone 

In order for us to heal our world  it s important for us to stop being afraid  If others react to you  opening up  by shunning you and being mean  then two things could be occurring  They re insecure and unaware that their actions are destructive  and or you re expressing yourself in a cringey way that is self centered 

It s our responsibility to find better ways of communicating  and when some people make fun of us and don t acknowledge us with respect  we can continue to share with others and realize that we don t need to be controlled by others  Irrational fear is an illusion  and it s time for us to stop being afraid and start loving each other "
10958,Sometimes people say If you don t speak you re weak  if you speak too much you re weak    Like really make up your mind  Just let me vent or get this rock of my shoulder 
10959,This bothers me too
10960,Cuz I do deal with it
10961,I don t see how  Maybe I m missing a correlation
10962,"I honestly don t get the whole point of debating who s  strong  or not  It just seems like a pissing match  

It s possible to find strength in pretty much everything  and not everybody shows it in the same way "
10963,Maybe some people don t open up because every time they ever have they get hurt in some way  Opening up shouldn t be based off of if you re strong or not it should be when you are ready and comfortable to  It s shouldn t be hard to do  if it is don t do it  you aren t ready 
10964," If u open up you re stronger and u got over your feelings

I kind of get what you mean  though sadly that is not the way others tend to perceive it  I try to be the most true  sincere  transparent person to those around me  but I can get shunned for opening up

Could just be my society culture factors  like being a guy and all that"
10965,It will always be hard for some people  that doesn t mean they should never do it
10966,There will always someone out there supporting you  You should support those who need it too 
10967,Sometimes just the odd appreciation is enough for a little push   
10968,"Me   Can I do it  

Brain   No  

Me   Can I do it  

Friend   Yes

10974,Dogs are Decent people  They would understand 
10975,Seriously  I walk ten feet to the laundry room and he sits in front of the door the entire time whining  There s a chance that because of all of this I may end up working remotely permanently  but if it doesn t happen it s going to be a rude awakening

Make a conscious effort to notice the present moment through each of your senses

4 things you feel

3 things you hear

1 thing you taste

1 thing you smell
