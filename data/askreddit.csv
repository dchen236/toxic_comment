What's the worst punishment you ever received as a child?		t5_2qh1i	"I was driven about 30 minutes outside of my city to an isolated, large, and creepy looking building, which I was told was an orphanage.

I was given the choice of ""teling the truth"" and admitting to something I had not done or being left there.

What's the worst punishment you ever received as a child?		t5_2qh1i	"The pointless ones.

We had landscaping rocks in our yard from an unfinished project, they were probably 30lbs each.  

After a number of other punishments failed, my parents came up with the ""move rocks"" punishment. I'd have to move 30 or so of these rocks 50 yards. Set them up into a particular shape (square, circle, etc.), have my parents check them and then move them all back.

The pointlessness of it all was the worst."	6591	1589994728.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gncojw/whats_the_worst_punishment_you_ever_received_as_a/fr9b9db/	1

What's the worst punishment you ever received as a child?		t5_2qh1i	"I was the youngest of 3 girls in my family. My worst punishment came after my dad left. As a baby, my dad would beat my sisters for any little thing they did wrong but because I was born on his birthday, he saw me as ""special"".

My father was a drunk, drug addict who bought fear into the home and only I wasn't touched by his fists and feet.

My sisters and mom were all victims and while they tended their wounds I was smothered and loved.

They hated me for it.

Dad left and now no one was protecting me.

What was my worst punishment? I was locked up.

 My mom would lock in me in my room for hours and my sisters had free rein on me with their punishments.

Every time I stepped out of line, I was reminded how much hate there was.

I was beat by my sisters and neglected by my mother.

My worst punishment was when I said to my mom that I hated her and the family and I wished they were all dead. She grabbed me by the hair, dragged me into the laundry and locked me in there.

The floor was stone and it was winter. I remember being so cold it hurt.

I guess I was asleep when I was eventually let out.

I hated my punishments.

The locking up stopped when I was around 12."	4184	1589993452.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gncojw/whats_the_worst_punishment_you_ever_received_as_a/fr98jz2/	1

He is a little fella. As are his mother and my self.

The next day my father picks him up and dropped him off to my girlfriend at our house. After dinner she went to put him in the shower and was horrified at what she saw. Imagine a tiny 7 year old boy with a completely bruised ass. And I mean deep purple, yellow and green bruises. She called me immediately. I rushed home from work, calling the police on my way. A Sargent from my local pd was very helpful and supportive to my little boy. Told me what to file and how to file it and that I should rush to children's hospital. He also called his lifelong best friend who is a captain in the town where my ex-wife lives. Within 2 weeks I had full emergency custody and she had domestic violence charges. Fast forward a year and I'm a sole custodial parent and my son is THRIVING! He has gained almost 20 lbs. Can now ride a bike without training wheels. He could not ride one at all when we took custody. Good food. Positive attention.

I had valid reasons that I gave to my parents several times before, but my dad is hella strict so still made me apply to that school.

We got home and my dad was furious. He took my phone and the door to my room. I went to bed early and in the middle of the night, he came to my room, told me to get up and draw the curtains. I only had underwear and a t shirt on. As I got up he used a long mwiko (basically wooden cooking stick) of around 16 inches to whack the shit out of me. I screamed in pain, but this guy didn't care he hit me everywhere, bruises and scars like I had never seen until the stick broke and he took off his slipper and continued to hit me for like 10-15 minutes saying how he felt disrespected and who I thought I was acting like that.

But the scariest beating I saw happened to my best friend in high school. We were supposed to be having a sleepover at her house but instead we went out and partied till 3am.

Edit: For everyone asking if I called the cops or reported her dad two things: I was 15 y/o and never experienced anything like that in my life. I was definitely in shock and scared for my life as this was unfolding. Obviously that's not an excuse.

For those who don't know, a Buck Rag is a rag that's been rubbed all over a male goat in rut. It's used for some goat breeding purposes (lady goats love the smell).

In our town, some parents would buy these rags from goat farmers to punish children for misbehaving. You take the child out back, pull the rag out of the jar, drape it over the child's face, and tie a knot in the back. It's not dangerous, but it makes them smell the horrible goat odor.

Tip: lightly rub some sandy dirt on it.

Had friends whose parents forced them over fire with hot spices thrown in it - gladly the general consensus is that this is an outdated and terrible cultural practice in punishing anyone, so less of it is happening nowadays

Edit: imagine hot spices... Now imagine breathing the smoke that comes from burning those spices. It’s used to be a torcher technique in East Africa. You don’t wanna have a person in that kind of smoke for more than a few seconds because they’ll die before giving you the intel you need.

The worst punishment I received was having my phone, car and laptop taken away for a crime I didn't commit. Basically, my parents found a fifth of expensive Scotch Whisky missing from the liquor cabinet and blamed me until about a week later when one of our family friends called thanking them for the gift.

What's the worst punishment you ever received as a child?		t5_2qh1i	"I was 14 and my 4 younger siblings and I were taken in by our grandfather after my mom lost custody of us to the state. They were radical Catholics who sexually abused my baby sister and forced us to do lots of things children should not be subjected to.

They read my diary. Surprise, they didn’t like what they saw. My only prior offense was shoplifting some earrings from a Claire’s.

They charged me with conspiracy to commit murder. They put me into handcuffs and took me through a hidden exit (from the school.) I was taken in a police car to the psychiatric unit of the local hospital where I played guitar hero for the first time. From there I was taken 80 miles away to another town, to a home for wayward youths. 

There I learned lots of new tricks and schemes, but did not use these for ill gains as my fellow inmates did. I was scheduled for release two months after entry. My therapist was fighting for us because she knew I didn’t belong there and I only wanted to get home and take care of my little siblings. Luckily once our Indian tribe got wind of the fucked up situation, they ordered their own investigations. We were then reunited as a family after a horrible life-altering ordeal.

I did not graduate high school after losing four months total of schoolwork freshman year after my moms DUI. I did get my GED and I still love learning and writing.

There were many ""worst"" punishments handed out, but one that sticks out the most happened one summer when I was about 8 years old. My stepfather stripped me down and tied me to a post with a chain that and locked it with a padlock around my neck. I am a very fair-skinned individual so I burned up real fast. I was also beaten with a wooden switch every hour until I admitted: ""What I had done wrong"". Every time I gave a wrong answer ( and I did a lot because I had no idea what he was talking about ) I was beaten again. I spent 4 days tied to that post. Day and night. hungry, thirsty, and very scared. The only comfort was a golden retriever that would settle in next to me every time my stepfather went back inside. On the fourth day, an Amish kid from the farm next door came down and cut my chain (His name was Charlie). We went to the police but back then the police were largely indifferent when it came to child abuse and they returned me home. I was forced to live inside the dog house for the remainder of the summer until school started again.

What's the worst punishment you ever received as a child?		t5_2qh1i	When I was 8 years old, my mentally unstable mom duct taped me to a chair, turned the lights off and left me in my room for something like 8 plus hours. When she returned I was still sobbing and had pissed myself. I told my teacher about it at school, and started crying. So she told DHS, they came by the house and saw how crazy my mom was. Then I was placed at my dads house permanently (they got divorced when I was younger) and my mom hated my dad so much, that she kidnapped me on one of her visitation days. The cops found us about a week later... i have blocked out most of the horrible things that happened when I was with her full time. I just remember feeling relieved that I was in the cops car and he was being nice to me. Later as an adult, I forgave my mom. Tried to let her in my life, but she kept refusing to get mental help. So I cut her out again. Then when I was in my mid 20’s, I found out that she had died from stage 4 breast cancer, and I didn’t know it happened for about 4 months or so. My brother kept it from me and her entire family. They always had an unhealthy relationship, he was like her little bitch boy. She could do no wrong when it came to him. Basically I’m glad she’s no longer alive, causing people pain. She was a clinical narcissist with personality disorders. I’m now almost 40 years old, and I realize that she was mentally unstable, and karma is real. Love you mom, but I never liked you.

Some neighborhood kids were staying the day while their family was at work, and we were outside playing. One of the kids (a notorious neighborhood bully) ran inside and told my mom that I had pushed him. 

She proceeded to make me stand with my legs spread as far as they could, bend over and hold my self up in kind of a triangle position.

I wasn’t allowed to move or use the bathroom. 

I was there for about 12 hours, well past sundown. 

I shit and pissed myself, and my piss rolled down my stomach/chin into my mouth. 

I was made to sleep on a cot outside and in the morning she washed me off with a hose. 

I was bullied my whole life for that one."	279	1589993432.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gncojw/whats_the_worst_punishment_you_ever_received_as_a/fr98ig1/	1

What's the worst punishment you ever received as a child?		t5_2qh1i	"I accidentally forgot a pair of underwear that I needed to pick up and take to my room when I was 6. My mother was a huge neat freak and flipped out. She got my bedroom door open and grabbed me by the back of my neck and shoved me to the bathroom. She then threw me on the floor and was screaming about picking it up. I did and she told me to put it in the hamper (I ran, because I knew how she was) and tripped. She grabbed me by the collar and lift me up and choked me against the wall with her hands. I legit couldn't breathe. She let me go before I passed out, screamed at me to put it in the hamper. I did. And then she told me to go get the belt. I cried and begged her to not. It makes me sick to think of how she could handle a small child saying ""please no mama. Please please no. I'll be good. I promise. I'm sorry Mama. Please no"". When I didn't get the belt she grabbed a wire hanger from my closet. I tried to run and she grabbed me and ripped my pants down and beat me. I was bloody and bruised all down my back and legs. 

That's just one of them that my brain found less horrifying and didn't block out. A lot of them I don't remember.

The situation was me and my siblings were playing the Wii, and my dad came in to tell us to tidy up. I was sorta pissed, so as I took my school bag out the room it hit my brother's face.

It would of only hurt a bit realistically.

My dad got pissed as fuck for some reason and thought it was a good idea to throw me across the room.

He realised what the fuck he just did and left the room. I had landed on the sofa, but broke my arm. I told my mum I tripped over and my siblings and I still hold that secret."	60	1589994617.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gncojw/whats_the_worst_punishment_you_ever_received_as_a/fr9b0z4/	0

What's the worst punishment you ever received as a child?		t5_2qh1i	"Let me preface this by saying that I have autism and find social interaction difficult.

My best friend from school had come round to play and I wanted to show him my Thomas the Tank Engine toy I got. He then said ""oh thanks Mitchell!"" Obviously thinking I was giving it to him. I corrected him and that it's mine, I'm just showing it to him.

Mum overheard this and came raging at me. She took the toy from my hands and bounced it on the floor like a basketball. It didn't work after this.
But I guess I didn't seem too affected by this, because later that day, while I was watching TV, she came downstairs holding this cardboard periscope I made a few weeks ago. She then proceeded to drop it on the floor and stomp it flat, ripping the cardboard in the process. I didn't really show much emotion to that as I just gave a very quick cry, then immediately resumed watching TV.

She's never done anything like that again, but I still don't show her (or anyone else) anything I create from the fear that she'll use it against me. And I do create a lot now. I have a 3d printer and I love it, and I'm learning woodwork as well. But I keep my creations rather secret."	111	1589993262.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gncojw/whats_the_worst_punishment_you_ever_received_as_a/fr9856g/	0
What's the worst punishment you ever received as a child?		t5_2qh1i	"Carry over from a post I had made previously

When I was about 7 my mother and step dad at the time bought a new couch. You know the type a nice new leather couch. Well later that day my parents left for some reason I can't remember why. Maybe the went to the neighbor's house. Well while they were gone me and my little brother who was 3 years younger then me devised a plan. I had recently discovered that sharp objects could stab into cardboard boxes, and it was a fun little game. We found some boxes in the garage, And I took the knives out of the kitchen drawer. We positioned the boxes on top of the couch and stab the boxes a bunch of times. not realizing you were stabbing right through them into the couch. After we were done we realized our mistake. Knowing my stepdad would be furious I hid the knives in our walk-in closet. And threw the boxes in the trash outside. I then put a blanket over the couch to hide it.

When my step dad came home  it wasn't hard for him to figure out what we had done. He flew into a rage grabbed me by my shirt and yelled at me. He screamed at me and asked what I had done. My brother was already crying by this point, I told him about the boxes and the knives. He then asked where the knives were at, and I told him in the closet. He opened the closet door and found them. he picked me up by the shirt and threw me into the closet. As I landed I felt the knife's pierced through my thighs, my butt, and my hands. He screamed at me ""Don't fucking move"" he then attempted to slam the closet shut but my right leg was still in the doorway. He then grabbed my little brother by the throat with his right hand picked him up off the ground and pinned him against the wall. He choked my brother until he was blue, at this point I was trying to collect myself. I stood up and noticed that only one of the knives was still stuck in me. I pulled the knife out of my thigh, and limped over to my step dad. I hit him in the back and told him to stop. He then let go of my brother and his lifeless body fell to the ground unconscious. He turned around and grabbed me by the hair dragging me into the kitchen. He grabbed the wooden pizza paddle then dragged me back into the living room. He then bent me over his leg and hit me on the butt. Every time I would squirm or try to run away he would hit my thighs. My legs would flail and I would scream for about the first 20 hits. I lost track of how many times he hit me but my body went limp. When he was done he threw me to the floor where I laid until my mother got home. At this point my brother had regained consciousness and was crying. My step dad walked over to him grabbed him by the back of his shirt collar and dragged him to the living room. He pulled off his belt and whipped him in his back until my brother stopped screaming. I pissed myself from the pain that day. When he realized that he grabbed me and dragged me over to the couch. pulled down my pants, he then threw me onto the couch, and told me to stay there. He was screaming at me saying ""oh so we want to pee our fucking pants now"" ""well if you can't be a big boy I'll fucking teach you"" he went to the bathroom and grabbed one of my sister's diapers. He then forced me into the diaper and paddled me again. My little brother ran out of the house at this time. My step dad chased him down and dragged him back in by his hair.  He then threw us in our room locked the door with something, and we stayed in there for the rest of the night. There was no police report filed, no neighbors called the cops, and my mother didn't say anything."	878	1589989883.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gncojw/whats_the_worst_punishment_you_ever_received_as_a/fr914xl/	2
What's the worst punishment you ever received as a child?		t5_2qh1i	i hate to be that one to say it but my mum had an abusive boyfriend. one morning leading up to Christmas i woke up really early (obviously it was pitch black dark) so i did what any child would do and go downstairs to watch TV. since it was dark i turned on this little over head lamp thing and just sat and watched the TV for a while. at some point i must’ve fell asleep because i woke up to the sound of my mums boyfriend shouting at me to wake up. when i woke up he ripped into me for having the light on during the day time because it was ‘wasting electricity’. his punishment for this was to grab my hand and force me to grab onto the light that i had left on. obviously it was extremely hot. it was actually so hot i remember it made my hand sizzle like bacon in a hot pan. it was relatively brief but it was long enough to leave me with a scar and unable to open my own Christmas presents that year. any questions feel free to ask :)	149	1589993177.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gncojw/whats_the_worst_punishment_you_ever_received_as_a/fr97ykn/	0

He did a lot of shitty things, but that was the worst.	7391	1589997390.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gncojw/whats_the_worst_punishment_you_ever_received_as_a/fr9gvyg/	3

What's the worst punishment you ever received as a child?		t5_2qh1i	"My mom used to literally back me into a corner then start swinging. She'd stop after she got tired or thought I ""learned my lesson."" The next day she'd buy me a shitty little crystal knickknack from the drugstore as an apology. It would happen about twice a year. I'd threaten to call the police, she'd say ""They wont believe you and arrest you for lying!""

This went on for years.

One day, when I was 16, she thought I was being mouthy so she walked up behind me and backhanded me in the back of my head. I had enough of it and pushed her away. She started screaming to my dad that I was attacking her,  he came in and put his hands on me and I wrapped my hands around his throat until he tapped and and was begging me to stop. I left home for almost a month, couch surfing and probably putting myself in way too dangerous situations for a minor. I didn't go back home until my dad finally apologized to me when he got the truth of what happened from my mom. As soon as I got back home I gave away or tossed all the shitty crystal apology gifts from my mom. 

I confronted my mother about all this a couple years ago on Mother's Day. She denies any of it ever happening and claimed ""I think I'd remember if that happened."" My dad can't verify any of it since she'd always do it while he was at work. But he got real quiet when I mentioned it. I'm pretty sure he knows it happened and feels guilty that he never knew.

I'm 32 years old now. I'm on good terms with both of my parents. Well, in all truth, I'm on good terms with my dad and I can tolerate my mother. I've never forgiven her or ever forgotten what she did. She can claim whatever she wants but I *know* what happened. I have the scars and fractures which never quite healed right. I have the occasional nightmares about it to this day. I can only hope that I rise above it all and don't make petty decisions when I'm in control and she's helpless.

I'm so sorry for what happened to you and further sorry for dumping all this bullshit here. You know what happened despite what she claims. Don't ever feel bad about staying true to yourself and what happened. All you can do now is hope that the future brings the best for yourself due to your own strength and perseverance.

EDIT:
Thanks for overwhelming support and kind thoughts in response to this post. My heart goes out to everyone who responded and shared their own stories. If nothing else, you all should know that you're not alone in this world and didn't deserve what happened when you were a child.

What's the worst punishment you ever received as a child?		t5_2qh1i	"pediatric fecal retention syndrome, my daughter has this. It isn't your fault.

Edit: for small children/infants over 12 months, daily use of Restorolax or fibre based laxative. Older children can use this as well, but are more likely to learn not to use the wrong muscles when defecating. The restoralax stops the pain/fear cycle as the child learns it won't hurt anymore to go.

Basically the infant begins solid foods. The poo becomes more solid and some constipation is normal at this stage (which is why there is baby pureed prunes to help). 

However some babies will ""posture"" (looks like masturbating and may eventually become a masturbation method) their legs in a rhythmic pattern as they are using the incorrect muscle in the rectum and are instead holding the poo, usually to try to prevent the poo from coming out and hurting, or sometimes just because they figure out the pooing sensation to push incorrectly. 

This poo then gets bigger and harder because it dries out, causing megastools and the body finally forces it out and they can experience severe pain from this, making the cycle next time worse as they try to prevent it. Diarrhea is also a symptom of constipation. 

There is functional constipation as well, which is different, but may be related. 

Now that my daughter is older (4) she is still on a capful of Restoralax a day (pediatrician told to do so), it can't harm her. However potty training is delayed as she is afriad of anything to do with defecation.

What ALSO happens is the parent or doctor or teacher becomes frustrated and may start harsh discipline and punishment for the child not defecating properly, making it an anxiety related thing."	3013	1589997075.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gncojw/whats_the_worst_punishment_you_ever_received_as_a/fr9g8i9/	4

Edit: sweet maple-syrup Batman, this blew up. Thank you all for your support and I feel for every single one in this thread. To those suffering currently, run. Get out. There's a lot of threads that say to tread carefully, and yes, I was homeless once I escaped, but do it. Just do it. I now have a house, a support network, and I'm not strictly non-con because of the siblings. Every time I hear my egg donor's voice, I feel an anxiety attack quickly taking hold. Run. Run far far away, even if you wait until you're stable, run. The law won't always help, and neither will the state, so you have to make sure that you get out of it. Therapy will be your best friend. Talking to people you know and trust, even ranting to strangers online helps. We listen. There's a lot of subreddits on here that I rely on to remind myself that I can't just automatically think that X was my fault or Y was normal. It *will* get better. It might get worse, it might stay terrible for a while, it might suck and you might want to give up, but there will be a break in the rain. It might not be the Deus ex Machina you hope for, but non-con will be the most amazing feeling in the world. If your toxic relatives reach out, you will get to laugh and hang up on them. It will be okay to cry after -- it will still hurt and go against everything you were gaslighted into believing. You are the master of your fate, you are the captain of your soul."	2423	1589994321.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gncojw/whats_the_worst_punishment_you_ever_received_as_a/fr9aef4/	2

What's the worst punishment you ever received as a child?		t5_2qh1i	I mean, I was not allowed to leave the table until I finished eating, but my mom would just sit me back if I stood up. Mostly we chit chatted while I took bout three hours to finish eating and she did whatever around the house from where she could see me and tell me to eat from time to time.	49	1589995775.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gncojw/whats_the_worst_punishment_you_ever_received_as_a/fr9dhy6/	0
What's the worst punishment you ever received as a child?		t5_2qh1i	"One time my little brother wouldn't stop chewing with his mouth open, so my dad put his plate on the floor and made him eat off of it like a dog. This happened like 3 or 4 times, and he wouldn't stop chewing with his mouth open. He wouldn't eat off the floor, so he was basically just sent to bed without dinner. 

It turns out my brother has a deviated septum and one of his nostrils is completely blocked, and the other is like partially obstructed. So it's actually really hard for him to breathe through his nose, which is why he was opening his mouth so much. My dad felt really bad when he found out...."	95	1589998027.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gncojw/whats_the_worst_punishment_you_ever_received_as_a/fr9i6ti/	0

What's the worst punishment you ever received as a child?		t5_2qh1i	">  mom was soo angry (not particularly at me just in general which is more messed up) 

I know that feel. My mom would often just scream and shout at me because people in her life were stressing her out. Like she'd be talking to the utility company and they were being hard to handle so she'd get frustrated and just start shouting at me. And being a kid, I had no idea that it wasn't *me* she was mad at, since I asked her to stop and she just kept going.

On the bright side, I can socially manhandle anybody who shouts and screams since I basically ignore it. Folks who do that aren't used to people just steamrolling them and dismissing whatever power they've got.

...But it does mean my brain kinda shuts off when somebody shouts at me in anger. I just can't take them or what they're saying seriously and instinctively want to dismiss it and them as human beings."	1376	1589995735.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gncojw/whats_the_worst_punishment_you_ever_received_as_a/fr9dewv/	1

What's the worst punishment you ever received as a child?		t5_2qh1i	I feel you on that. I was grounded for two straight years my sophomore and junior year because my grades were poor (they were poor because I was also getting abused, but abusive parents don't exactly connect the dots). Extremely restricted electronics use, no seeing my friends at all. That's probably why they don't talk to me anymore. They all got way closer with each other than they did with me because I couldn't participate in anything. Even in my senior year, when I was no longer grounded, they just didn't bother inviting me to anything because they were used to me not being able to go.	57	1589997632.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gncojw/whats_the_worst_punishment_you_ever_received_as_a/fr9hdw7/	0

What's the worst punishment you ever received as a child?		t5_2qh1i	"I feel you there. My experience with my journal being read wasn't as bad as this, though.

I kept my actual feelings in a little brown book in a dark recess of my desk in my bedroom. During the daily ""search my entire room while I'm away at school"" check, (which I was unaware of at the time was happening), they find it and read it back to front. They find a four year old entry about me feeling like shit and being a little suicidal. I think I said ""it feels hopeless"" or something.

They called the school, and had me pulled out to go home immediately. I had no idea what was going on besides ""family emergency"".

My father left work early on emergency leave, so they could have a two hour talk with me about ""what's wrong with me"". At the end, they were completely stuck in their own heads and weren't grooving with anything I said, which only reinforced the entire point of why I'd written that.

Later on, after it cooled off, I destroyed my journal and began to keep it online, in my personal emails google drive storage.

A year, maybe less pass, then lo and behold they told Google that I was a minor (I was, however I was 16-17 at that point), and they forked over access and they mangled my folder structure just to find anything they can ""have a talk"" with me about.

They find the new and improved online journal and we have yet another family emergency and ""talk about what's wrong with my head"". 

At this point I'd been seeing a number of different ""therapists"" which were all mostly people who bothered me and or creeped me out. Some flat out lied to my face. All of them had a meeting with my parents after our chats and played them recordings / told them the play by play of what I said. That makes me think they weren't real therapists but I don't know the word.

I don't keep any kind of record anymore of how I feel for fear of literally anyone reading it and having a meltdown over it.

Hope things are better for you, stranger. :)"	97	1589996959.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gncojw/whats_the_worst_punishment_you_ever_received_as_a/fr9fznr/	0

What's the worst punishment you ever received as a child?		t5_2qh1i	"Had a similar experience except it was the day after. 

I was around 17 years old, and my parents had caught me out that night drinking with friends. Unexpectedly, my dad woke me up at 7:00 the next morning and had me doing yard-work until the sun set. Never once did he mention the night before. 

Honestly I think he made the right decision. If you’re going to drink, you still have to take care of the next day’s responsibilities—even if they are unexpected.

Edit: 

Figured I’d give a shoutout to my dad. The man had an alcoholic/abusive step-father that he grew up with who routinely punished him with some of the terrible methods in this thread. He’s done everything in his power as a parent to help guide his kids in the right direction. He is one of the most fair-minded and just people I’ve ever come across, and it’s clearly visible in how he dealt with my brother and me. I hope to be at least half of the man/parent that he is."	1745	1589990606.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gncojw/whats_the_worst_punishment_you_ever_received_as_a/fr92mei/	2

What's the worst punishment you ever received as a child?		t5_2qh1i	"I found a solution that seems to work with my kids, ages 2 and 4.  

They don't have to eat their food.  But treats and desserts and only for people who eat their dinner - parents included.  There's a reason grown ups get fat.  

We also have seen a rise in better eating behaviors since we started having them participate in making dinner.  They get to peel carrots and potatoes, hold a pan while we spray it w/ oil, and watch the timer to let us know when it's done.  I think by participating, they feel less inclined to reject."	214	1589998557.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gncojw/whats_the_worst_punishment_you_ever_received_as_a/fr9jao7/	1

What's the worst punishment you ever received as a child?		t5_2qh1i	"Honestly, I'm fine. I'm in my late 20s and lm doing really well.

I used to have bad episodes of PTSD and while I'm still diagnosed with it, I can function. If you saw me on the street, you wouldn't even guess it.

Dad came back into my life and after he beat up my puppy, I haven't spoken a word to him. Puppy is fine by the way and is a huge dog now and he's afraid of him. 

My sisters are sort of okay? The eldest has children of her own and is living well.

The second sister is crazy unfortunately.

She's narcissistic at best. We have a younger brother and he's autistic and unfortunately she's learned a lot of behaviour traits from our father. Though she doesn't hit him anymore, she and her verbal and mental abuse is still quite damaging. I'm working to eventually be able to bring my brother to live with me in the future.

Our mother was also diagnosed with autism later in my teenage years. Her locking me away was her way of dealing with me. 

I don't know if I can forgive her yet but I understand some of her actions."	1469	1590001574.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gncojw/whats_the_worst_punishment_you_ever_received_as_a/fr9pl6j/	1

What's the worst punishment you ever received as a child?		t5_2qh1i	"My dad did this once to me when I called him a bastard... don't remember why I did that, probably blocked it out.  My mom was home and stopped him. He didn't like it that I couldn't be his defenseless verbal punching bag that would just take it before.  I hated when my mom went to church and my dad stayed home.  He would dump about his problems, failures and shortcomings (many self induced, just his old man) for hours... and hours a day and he wouldn't let leave the room or go upstairs. It would end usually shortly before my mom would get home. I had to take medicine (obviously after moved out because my dad didn't  believe in Rx drugs and ADHD was ""a myth."") and therapy because I was such a cynical person being exposed to that shit at such a young age. I messaged my mom a few weeks ago and told her that after seeing the difference after I was on medicine, I realized my cynicism and told her he's a cynical person and I was going to rise above and break the cycle.

My parents slowed down the rate at which they spanked me and my siblings once my mom had hit my older sister so hard that she was covered in bruises. That’s when they pulled the soap out. Soap is bearable imo, so they saved the vinegar for me. It was often enough that I vividly remember having to pull the vinegar out of the fridge myself over and over until it was easy to drink. At that point, grounding me was seemingly just as effective.

Edit: my three older siblings had permission to punish me with vinegar, so it happened far more often than it would have otherwise. It went from small capfuls entire to shots-worth"	2650	1589990712.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gncojw/whats_the_worst_punishment_you_ever_received_as_a/fr92u95/	1

14-15 years old. Came home drunk.

My mom was mad as hell screaming and crying. 
Dad seemed fairly calm. 

After I puked in the toilet a few times and sobered up some he just said ""go to your room""


5AM the light came on in my room and he said ""get up, take a shower and be ready to go in a half hour""

My dad was a roofer. In Florida. 
And it was summer. 

I spent the entire day hauling bundles of shingles and buckets of nails from one end of the worksite to the other. 

I knew not to complain because whatever alternate punishment he was going to come up with was going to be worse.

He never said anything about my drinking that night. 

Some years later I skipped school and went out on a boat with some friends. 

Unbeknownst to me, dad happened to be out on his boat fishing. 

We passed by him and he immediately yelled ""get your ass over here""

I thought I was done for as we had beers in the boat too. 

He made me get on his boat and cussed me out for skipping school and basically called all my friends a bunch of shitheads.

Then he made sure we had enough life jackets, a paddle and plenty of fuel and let us go with the warning ""have your ass back home before dark""

He was a tough but fair man."	40	1589996064.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gncojw/whats_the_worst_punishment_you_ever_received_as_a/fr9e484/	0

As far as how I'm doing now; well this last week it's been rough... I'm 24 now and this shit happen over here a decade and a half ago. This is the first time I've really told anybody these stories and it's all over the internet, people I don't know. Living in a constant state of fear as a kid you learn to isolate and close yourself off. My girlfriend of two years knows I was abused but I've never told her any of the stories. so this is a new experience for me and it's been difficult.

However overall I'm doing pretty good I currently work as a CASA for abuse and neglected youth. As well as a behavioral specialist for kids with SEDs (severe emotional disturbances). Being able to relate to those kids and tell them that they're not alone is by far the most rewarding thing I've ever done.

What's the worst punishment you ever received as a child?		t5_2qh1i	"My daughter has ADHD. She's sweet and honest. Sometimes she has trouble paying attention or sitting still or following instructions. She's five. My dad will be complaining about her being too squirrelly and I'll say something like, ""Yeah, I really need to take her out and let her run around a little,"" and he over and over and over again says, ""Or you just need a paddle!"" He keeps offering to make me one and I say no. He says, ""I had a paddle for you and you turned out alright!"" Honestly, I remember the paddle. I remember the spankings. They sucked and they didn't deter me, because I also have ADHD and had impulse control problems. I just learned to lie about everything to stay out of trouble. 

I'm glad my daughter is honest. And she always tries to do the right thing. And when she makes a mistake or is having trouble containing herself, I know exactly how she feels and try to help her find a better way to work through it. Sometimes she has to face consequences, sure, but a paddle is not going to do anything but teach her to lie."	90	1589996477.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gncojw/whats_the_worst_punishment_you_ever_received_as_a/fr9eze2/	0

What's the worst punishment you ever received as a child?		t5_2qh1i	"The terrifying part about people like her is she'd be choking us and cutting us, throwing things and screaming with the fury Hades couldn't manage from the Hercules animated movie, and then it would flip over to cheerful happiness if the phone rang and she answered it. She'd shout and break holes in doors and walls until she was red in the face, and in another moment, she'd be red faced but smiling when the phone rang, ready to give a ""Hey [name]"" to whoever called, as if she hadn't just punched her young second grade daughter in the face. 


We were in foster care for a week once. She talked her way out of it. There were fourteen cases opened and closed, from no less than eight different people. I managed to get photos once (in the era before smart phones) and they said I'd faked them. That was actually one of the instances tht led to the scars on my arm that she gave me.

Management knew or was suspicious of it, but not so much as a write up our reprimand. Eventually, management changed, figured out no work was being done, called it fraud, and canned them.

What is the worst thing that you've seen a coworker do and still avoid being fired?		t5_2qh1i	"I work at a psychiatric hospital and we had a patient who was blind and who was admitted for drug induced psychosis along with visual and auditory hallucinations. At my hospital we only accept the people who are an immediate danger to themselves or others. When a patient first comes to us they are put on a check sheet meaning every 10 minutes a staff member needs to see that the patient is breathing and safe. But sometimes we need to do a one to one (1:1) meaning a staff member needs to be with this person at all times, either for their safety or the safety of other patients. We also have little body alarms and floor alarms for patients (mostly geriatrics) who are unsteady while walking and need assistance. These devices let us know when they get up so we can assist them.


So anyway the blind patient was on a 1:1 and was taking a nap in their room. The staff had a laptop to do some charting while sitting on the 1:1. Well this staff member put the laptop on the floor, left the room all while neglecting to hook up any of the body or floor alarms. While the staff member was out of the room our patient got up from their bed and tripped over the laptop and face planted. Another staff noticed and we ran down to take vitals and make sure the patient was okay. Thank goodness the patient wasn't injured, but we were furious with our co-worker for leaving. Their excuse was they needed to get some paperwork they had been putting off.


All in all this person didn't get fired (lord doesn't even know why) but did get a slap on the wrist. My co-workers and I were *pissed*! You do not leave a patient while on 1:1, even if they are asleep!"	103	1590014492.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gnkf0k/what_is_the_worst_thing_that_youve_seen_a/fra9t6c/	5

The job interview also happened to be for a job at a sister location for our office. And they both used our manager as a reference. 

She got a phone call within minutes of their interviews, and collected their un-stamped time cards before they even got back to the office. 

She had them dead to rights for wage theft.

What is the worst thing that you've seen a coworker do and still avoid being fired?		t5_2qh1i	"Not my company, but an outside supplier (we'll call them ""Idiots, Inc"") we worked with regularly. They got some young turk sales guy (we'll call him Chad) in who took a liking to one of the young female employees at my company (who was engaged). Chad flirted with her a bit and finally asked her out on a date. She politely declined, saying that she was engaged. Chad wouldn't take no for an answer and continued to bother her. Nothing inappropriate, per se, but annoying and definitely unprofessional.

We called and asked for a new salesperson to be put on our account. Idiots, Inc. said no and that they would ""speak"" to Chad. Well, whatever they said just seemed to egg Chad on. It finally crossed the line from annoying to inappropriate. The whole thing culminated when he left a wildly inappropriate VOICE MAIL on her phone detailing all the things he'd do to her if he got her alone.

The young woman was understandably freaked out about that and got HR involved. That was the final straw (and I think it was more because my company was afraid of being sued rather than worrying about their employee's well being and safety, ugh.).

One of the female VPs called the owner of the company and played the message for him. The owner LAUGHED and said ""Oh, c'mon, boys will be boys..."" Well, the female VP made it her business to be sure that this company got not one more dime of our money. They were blacklisted and that was that...until this VP left the company about seven years later.

All of a sudden, we were doing business with them again. I reminded the COO about what happened (and he knew about it, don't kid yourself) and his response was basically ""Well, enough time has passed. Neither employee is with their respective companies anymore and they provide a good service at a good price, so we're using them."" Ugh.

 She constantly says we shoups drop people from services because they can't be contacted and then when somebody else tries they get somebody the first time.

What is the worst thing that you've seen a coworker do and still avoid being fired?		t5_2qh1i	"Posted this in a similar thread asking what is the worst coworker I've ever had. Honestly can't single out one thing from this guy.

Work as a server at a country club. One of the bartenders is an absolute garbage can of a human being.

Here's a list of just some of the shit he's done:

1) Got in a fist-fight with the old manager after closing time. At least twice.
2) Badmouthed other bartenders both to their faces and to members.
3) Only tends to members that he considers friends and knows are going to give him a generous tip.
4) Verbally abuses our food runners and dishwashers. Who are the purest people in the whole place.
5) We work right by the pool and he'll stare at any 16-year old girl in a two-piece. (He's like 40)
6) Looked a member dead in the eyes and actually said, ""your tits look amazing today.""
7) Told another member that he'd love for her to sit on his face.
8) Never makes drinks evenly, but has the nerve to try and lecture me for trying to make a vodka and soda.
9) Although he's married and has a teenage daughter, he still brags about hooking up with underage girls.
10) Has cussed out and threatened our food and beverage director.
11) Has repeatedly given away drinks in exchange for cash under the table.
12) Sexually assaulted female coworkers.

And the one that really pissed me off and led to my finding out about the rest of these was a few weeks ago when he left in the middle of a shift to go get a haircut, was gone for over 2 hours, and when he came back, most likely cross-faded based on his smell, he proceeded to hang out in the back while the rest of us worked. Outside. In Florida. In May. Wearing masks, gloves, and all black uniforms.

We also found out about his arrest record. There's a couple things for drugs. Like 5 things for domestic violence. Some other stuff too.

At the same plant, a woman set up a guy on a sexual harassment charge, got found out, and still kept her job.  She worked in R&D. He worked in the bag room where the bulk totes of grains were dumped into the hopper system to be pneumatically conveyed to the cookers. He was bending over one of the hoppers trying to dislodge a clog when she comes walking over. “Hey, Mr. X, nice ass. “
He looks a bit flustered and responds, “thanks, you too.”  All three of us go about our business and, as far as I know, think nothing of it.
She went straight to HR and filed a complaint against him.  I was the witness. That’s stupid shit listed me as the witness. It was very quickly found out to be bullshit and they did not fire her."	4	1590019108.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gnkf0k/what_is_the_worst_thing_that_youve_seen_a/frah7ni/	0

Anywayyyyyyyys. HR and the store manager call her into a meeting, sit her down and show her the video surveillance from OUTSIDE (which she obviously didnt know was there) showing her faking her fall. I dont know everything but she got called out hard and she broke down and admitted everything. For some reason they kept her on.

She then tried it AGAIN like six months later (this time claiming that a customer had something from their cart hit her or fall on her or something). Again, tried to claim workers comp and had this whole show of being injured. They pull up security footage AGAIN and disprove her injury/claims.

What is the worst thing that you've seen a coworker do and still avoid being fired?		t5_2qh1i	"The company I work for is notoriously hard to get fired from. As long as it’s not an ethical issue, you can get away with almost anything. 

I work for a car insurance company. We had an auto damage adjuster who was a bit of a legend. Some of the things he did:

* He once crashed a customer’s car into a wall. We weren’t supposed to drive the cars. He insisted he wasn’t driving it and didn’t know how it happened.

* He once sat down with the owner of one of our partnered body shops and told him that he didn’t believe in the use of body filler (bondo), and all repairs for cars from our company had to be done without any body filler. Anyone who has done body repair knows that that is literally impossible. The shop owner had to call his boss to get him to knock it off. 

* The same shop told this adjuster to take a base coat reduction for a repair. A base coat reduction is basically a discount that applies in certain situations where the shop is doing less work than what book time pays for. It’s industry standard, and doesn’t change the work that is actually being done, just the amount they are paid. The adjuster refused because “his morals wouldn’t let him do it”. The shop told him he’s overpaying them and to take the discount. His supervisor told him he’s overpaying them and to take the discount. He still protested. 

Eventually he got fired. Nobody knows what for. Must have been something big, or the company finally got tired of his shit."	2	1590018985.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gnkf0k/what_is_the_worst_thing_that_youve_seen_a/fragzoy/	0

Didn't call off or anything, he just didn't come in without even telling anyone. After that, he disappeared in the middle of a shift. No one could find him, so my boss and her boss went searching for him.

They found him sleeping in his car in the parking lot.

They then fired him on the spot. But THEN My boss' boss' boss, the store director, personally called this guy and essentially begged him to come back to work. So he did. He then walked off the job again. Instead of firing him, they gave him a 3-day ""adjustment period"".

What is the worst thing that you've seen a coworker do and still avoid being fired?		t5_2qh1i	"Federal workers work their job to the beat of a different drum than anybody else.


By that I mean they can't get fired anywhere NEAR what anybody else can.


Here's my story and it's true.

There was major theft on a federal site (that's a felony on federal property). The site decided to install a camera in the most affected building. They caught the guy stealing everything worth money. He got fired immediately!


JUST KIDDING!
That can't happen to federal workers lol. Because the site didn't ask the workers in the building if they minded having a camera installed to catch the thief, thus nullifying the entire reason to do so, the evidence couldn't be used to fire the federal worker and he still has his job to this day. 

Now you might wonder that this is a technicality rather than protection. 

I know a federal worker that allowed water tests to go unreported which was him basically letting everybody drinking the water be poisoned and he wasn't even allowed to be told he did wrong for all those years.

What is the worst thing that you've seen a coworker do and still avoid being fired?		t5_2qh1i	"I used to work at a terrible private school for preschoolers - 6th graders. It looked really fancy and had expensive tuition, but behind closed doors the teachers were so fucking mean to the kids.

One of the worst instances I think I ever witnessed was in one of the preschool classrooms. I was like an administrative assistant and so would be in and out of classrooms throughout the day doing various assistant stuff. However, my education and experience are actually in infant, toddler, and preschool care.

I was walking through the 2-year-old classroom and the teacher had all of the 2 year olds sitting completely still and silent on the rug as she delivered a ""lesson"" (one of the many red flags of this school was that they expected preschool and elementary age children to be quiet and still 100% of the time, and flew into a rage if any of the children dared to act like a child.) As I'm walking through the classroom, one of the 2 year olds makes eye contact with me and smiles. I smile back and give him a little wave. He gives an adorable giggle.

Then, the teacher suddenly stops mid sentence and her eyes snap to this little boy. She yells, ""excuse me?? What was that??"" The little boy is staring at her like a deer in the headlights. She then proceeds to *mock the little boy's laugh* in a way that let's just say mocked the way a person with an intellectual disability might speak. Her mocking tone was so full of genuine anger and hatred, and I was completely floored. I absolutely couldn't believe I was witnessing a teacher talk this way to 2 YEAR OLD CHILDREN.

That teacher still works there several years later, as does the entire staff of teachers, each of whom I witnessed verbally abusing children on multiple occasions.

I left shortly after, but not before writing them a scathing letter about all the horrible shit I watched them do to children. Fuck those people so hard.

She quit later that day.

When her boss found out about it and complained to the guy's manager in the sales department, the excuse was that a bunch of other sales people had quit in recent months and the department needed to maintain a minimum amount of people or their budget would be slashed.

She also groped me once and thought it was funny to sexually harass me and HR didn’t give a shit about all of this and didn’t bother to get involved because, well, HR is only there to protect the company, not the workers :)	1	1590023608.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gnkf0k/what_is_the_worst_thing_that_youve_seen_a/frapbaj/	0

What is the worst thing that you've seen a coworker do and still avoid being fired?		t5_2qh1i	I have a friend who worked as a manager at a place where it’s very hard to fire someone who is in a full time, benefitted position. He had an underling (hired by his predecessor) who was doing heroin **at work**. The employee was leaving behind paraphernalia like spoons and needles. My friend had to work with HR for six months before they finally let him fire the employee. Apparently my friend first had to prove it was him (it was a shared workspace, so the paraphernalia could have been anyone’s), and then he had to give three warnings and a work improvement plan. Once the employee failed the WIP, my friend was finally able to fire him.	1	1590023636.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gnkf0k/what_is_the_worst_thing_that_youve_seen_a/frapd5t/	0
What is the worst thing that you've seen a coworker do and still avoid being fired?		t5_2qh1i	"Working IT many years ago and we were selecting a large backup system - 100TB 20 years ago was a very big system.  We compared a few products and finally selected a system that was more expensive, but our team felt was a better product. 

About 3 months later our rep from the company that we bought the system from was fired.  Found out later that the lead engineer was give a large screen TV (20 years ago that value was over $10K) and Disney passes (company was in Orlando) and the company that sold it fired the rep because of it.  Our company kept the lead engineer.  

I believe the reason was a cover up to protect senior management.  The amount of money for this system was considerable and required board approval.  To have to tell the board that a) the deal was rigged and b) we paid more for the system than we should have for the system would have resulted in questions being asked that were touchy.  I believe the lead engineer said he would go to the board if they fired him."	1	1590023638.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gnkf0k/what_is_the_worst_thing_that_youve_seen_a/frapdb8/	0

What is the worst thing that you've seen a coworker do and still avoid being fired?		t5_2qh1i	"Worked with a woman who regularly showed up a couple hours late, took smoke breaks every 45 minutes or so, and didn’t actually produce any work. Worked in public service so firing someone takes years. She was erratic and often threatened people. Even after she told a coworker she was going to slit her boss’s throat, it took another six months to get her out. 

Worked with another woman who called in sick for several days about every month or so, but also in public sector so no repercussions other than people not liking her. One day she gets a travel advance (from the organization) to pay for a work trip a few days out. She spends the money then tells her boss she can’t go on the trip because she can’t afford it. She’d spent the organization’s money on rent or whatever. Rather than get her in trouble, the boss hands her his personal credit card to pay for her travel costs. She runs several non-work-related purchases on the card while on the trip and promises to pay him back. Now her boss is mad but takes her at her word (why, I don’t know). Several pay periods go by and not a cent paid back. When confronted she has some excuse and says the boss actually owes HER money because she isn’t paid enough. The boss finally takes the matter to the organization and the woman is accused of theft and gets fired—just a few months before she would earn full retirement and pension. 

In public sector, stealing will get you fired pretty quickly. Apparently, getting fired because you threatened to slit your boss’s throat will take a while longer."	1	1590023942.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gnkf0k/what_is_the_worst_thing_that_youve_seen_a/frapwsb/	0

What is the worst thing that you've seen a coworker do and still avoid being fired?		t5_2qh1i	"I once worked for a county road department. I was working with this one guy, driving around cutting weeds or whatever. He used to stop at his girlfriend's place regularly, I'd usually just sleep in the truck or something. One day he came running out with her, they got in and he drove the truck to a strawberry farm a few miles away. He pulled over on the shoulder, then she broke out a sizable bag of coke and started cutting up lines on a cassette case. We all did a bunch, then they get out. He tells me they're going to fuck in the strawberry field and I should hit the horn if anyone comes. 

So around fifteen minutes later our boss pulls up behind us. He hits his horn, gets out, comes up to the cab and asks me where so-and-so is. I'm whacked out of my gourd and I just stammer...""umm, uh, he went uh, ummm"". Then here comes so-and-so and his girlfriend, all disheveled and semi-dressed. He's all hunched over too, holding his crotch like he's in pain. 

Our boss just says WTF is this? He immediately fesses up (except about the blow) then says he's a sex addict, he can't control himself and he needs help. He then explains that in the rush to fuck her he just pulled her panties to the side instead of removing them which resulted in a severe dick abrasion he felt required medical attention. 

I drove the truck (and his GF) back, nothing happened to me at all. She did blow the whole way and was heavily flirting with me too. The guy did indeed go to the ER for cock burn, then he went to an inpatient facility for sex addiction for a few weeks. Got paid and everything. He started doing more coke and banging anything with a pulse the day he got back. He later went on to become a foreman there."	1	1590024045.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gnkf0k/what_is_the_worst_thing_that_youve_seen_a/fraq3i2/	0

Apparently it’s ok if it’s not a supervisor/subordinate situation.	1	1590016016.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gnkf0k/what_is_the_worst_thing_that_youve_seen_a/frabwyt/	2

What is the worst thing that you've seen a coworker do and still avoid being fired?		t5_2qh1i	"I worked at a relatively large chain pizza place that tends to have pizza hot and ready.

We had a big problem with dumpster divers going into our fenced in dumpster area and scaring the shit out of us to get their garbage pizza. At the end of every night, we would throw away hot pizzas because we had to keep them up in case customers came in last minute.

Well we had had it with these guys so two other coworkers, my manager and I all closed the store. We all took out the garbage that night (that never happened). We lit up the area with our phone flashlights, and one of my coworkers pulled his pants down, leaned up against the wooden fence, and SHIT on the hottest, freshest pizza and put it in the very top of the stack of garbage pizza. It was the first one that they would grab.

To this day, I still wonder what their thought was when they opened up that box to see a warm log laying right on top."	1	1590020785.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gnkf0k/what_is_the_worst_thing_that_youve_seen_a/frak8ha/	0

My boss admitted blame, he signed off & certified it without realising I had copied it from a proprietary job until I told him that was my reference material after the job was issued. We have a big database of industry standard reference material we use, but he also said I could use previous jobs as reference designs. However I was unaware at the time that some of our corporate designs where proprietary. We agreed that, at the level of experience I was at & the training I was given I wasn't fully expected to know that at that stage.

What is the worst thing that you've seen a coworker do and still avoid being fired?		t5_2qh1i	">Proceeded to send dick pics to the women at work and solicit nudes from them. Women said to stop or they'd take it up with management

I once talked to a male (not that that matters, much) co-worker about sexting. We talked about it like ""hey, have you ever done this with someone?"" ""Uh, yeah, with my GF when we had to do long distance due to studies"" ""Oh yeah okay, I see"" kinda conversation. Nothing vulgar, nothing explicit. There was a female co-worker in the same room we were in, but she didn't take part in the conversation nor was any directed to her and absolutely nothing we said was in any way disrespectful of women.  


Didn't stop both of us from being called into management a few days later, who told us there were complaints against us for sexually intimidating a co-worker. It took us about 10 seconds to figure out who and because of what and had a hard time understanding it. Even though we explained everything as it happened and asked if there was any evidence of the facts we were accused of -which there wasn't- we were written up for sexual harassing a female co-worker because we used the word ""sexting"" in the same room she was in.

What is the worst thing that you've seen a coworker do and still avoid being fired?		t5_2qh1i	We had an IT guy that was stealing old laptops after we replaced them for employees with new ones.  Funny thing was that we didn't give him a raise for five years since we knew about it, and apparently he didn't want to quit either out of fear of being discovered or due to the extra money he was making.  His raise would have been worth more than the laptops so we just let it continue.	60	1590017344.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gnkf0k/what_is_the_worst_thing_that_youve_seen_a/frae3zy/	0

Men, what’s the stupidest way you’ve hurt your balls?		t5_2qh1i	"When I was a teen, I was into skateboarding (need you read on?). Near my house there was a high, concaved kerb where lorries backed up for deliveries, with a bollard directly above.

Being of an age that I was filled with overconfidence in my own ability and a lack of concern for breaking bones, I decided that I could stand on top of the bollard and drop in on the kerb.

For some reason though, I didn't have the most sensible idea for getting atop the bollard. Rather than climbing onto it like a normal human being might, I thought a running jump was the way to go.

Towards the bollard I ran, skateboard in hand, and leaped through the air. My leading foot had the briefest of contact with the top of the bollard before continuing on past, my brain at this point remembering how momentum works and realising the error I had made.

Suffice to say I did a complete cartwheel before landing in a heap on the floor with much regret in my tackle."	78	1589987163.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gnbmlg/men_whats_the_stupidest_way_youve_hurt_your_balls/fr8vppe/	0

Men, what’s the stupidest way you’ve hurt your balls?		t5_2qh1i	"I was 13. My naive and idiotic self thought it would be a good idea to put my dick into the jets of my hot tub just to see what it felt like. It didn’t feel that good and I ended up getting a bladder infection because of it. 

For some reason, though, I never told my parents that something was wrong. I think it was just embarrassment, both of what I was doing, and talking to them about what was going on down there. I was having a really hard time urinating. It felt like I always had to go, but I would sit on the toilet for what felt like hours and hardly anything would come out. 

Anyways, while dealing with all of this, I took a bad fall in a basketball game and landed right on my stomach, smacking my nuts against the hardwood. The pain was nothing short of 7/10. I went straight to the bench and didn’t go back in the game that night. I remember driving home with my dad and brother, and just whimpering in pain in the back seat. My right nut swelled to about the size of an oddly shaped peach. I missed about a week of school before things got back to normal. It got worse, though. 

I don’t know how long I was back in school for, but I remember things still being pretty tender down there. For some reason, I decided to get back on the court. This was a huge mistake. This time, my teammate passed me the ball, and my defender just ran up into me, kneeing me directly in the sweet spot. The crazy thing was, it didn’t hurt. I got up, and was surprised that I felt alright. The other team was in foul trouble, so I went to the free throw line. I air balled it. And it wasn’t short, it was about 3 feet to the left. It was then that I knew something was wrong.

I went to the bench in some sort of state of shock. I remember looking up at my dad, and the look he gave me helped me understand that there was something going on that my body wasn’t aware of yet. It took about 15 minutes before I started to feel it. The game wasn’t even at half time, but I remember standing up, walking over to my coach, saying there was something wrong and I had to go. I walked over to my dad, and we left and drove straight to the ER.

By the time we got there, my testicle was the size of a grapefruit. I don’t remember much about the ER, but what I will never forget is the most tremendous pain I have ever, ever felt. It was a true 10/10. It felt like someone took one of those black binder clip things and just clamped it onto my nut. I was absolutely beside myself. I couldn’t get comfortable. Any slight movement made the pain worse, but it hurt so much that I couldn’t stay still. I remember that getting on all fours and letting it hang was the only relieving position I could find. When the doctor finally came to see me, it took everything I had just to lay down in the bed. As soon as I was settled, I felt the warm wash of morphine overtake me, and suddenly everything was 10x better...

I spent 10 days in the hospital. My testicle remained the size of a grapefruit for 6 days. I had a really shitty doctor, who basically said that we just needed to wait and let the swelling go down. My aunt, who was a nurse, ended up convincing my parents that we had to go to a different hospital to receive better care. The first day I got there, the first 10 minutes I spent with a doctor, they decided to remove it. I  went into surgery 6 hours after I got there. Almost a week of terrible, terrible pain could’ve been avoided so easily. I spent 4 days recovering in the hospital, and another month or so at home after that. My initial doctor lost his license a few years later because of a similar situation with a different patient. 

Apparently, whatever infection I had in my bladder spread to my epididymis and testicle after that first fall. The infection staying in there for as long as it did removed any chance of saving testicle. It was a really shitty thing, and I wish I had been a few years older, and a few years wiser when it happened. I had some insecurities in my youth that were hard to deal with after that.

The man shot me right in the balls and ass from 6 feet away with a paintball rounds that didn’t even burst, regardless of the rules that the ball had to burst for you to get out I was out due too a completely different ball bursting.

I could hear them gasp as i strained to turn the key off.	21	1589987696.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gnbmlg/men_whats_the_stupidest_way_youve_hurt_your_balls/fr8wqxh/	0
Men, what’s the stupidest way you’ve hurt your balls?		t5_2qh1i	"Anybody who has seen the movie Waiting probably knows what ""The Goat"" is. If not, it's when you tuck your balls between your legs and bend over in front of someone, making you look like a goat with dangly nuts. That's where my story begins...

About 7 years ago (or so), I was at home with my GF at the time. We had a fun relationship in terms of pranking each other and just giving each other shit pretty regularly and one of my favorite things was to surprise her with The Goat. Hiding behind corners so she'd see it when she came around or doing it behind her while she cooked so when she'd turn around, there would be my dangly balls and asshole. It was hilarious. So, one day, she's in the kitchen cooking something and I sneak in and drop trou, tuck back the boys, get in position, and wait. I'm standing there for about 30 or 40 seconds when she finally turns around, notices, and starts yelling/laughing. She starts trying to maneuver around the kitchen while keeping her back to me as I'm trying my absolute damndest to goat walk and force myself into her eyesight, laughing the whole time. This is where the story takes a turn for the worst...

As I'm half naked, goating around the kitchen, and tormenting my GF with my nuts, she grabs the dish towel off of the counter and threatens to towel snap me if I don't stop. I'm not entirely sure why, but i didn't believe her....I REALLY should have believed her. So, I pushed her a little further and then it happened...like she summoned the powers of Indiana Jones, she cracked that towel whip and DEAD ON NAILED me right square in the taint like an assassin. I should have known it was coming, but it still surprised me and hurt like hell so I immediately jerked and stood straight up. The only problem was the fact that my nuts were still tucked back pretty deep, so not only did I get my taint slapped with a lightning bolt from Odin, but I yanked my entire ballsack down and smashed it between my legs when I jerked up straight. I dropped to the floor, completely unsure as to which pain was worse, and just curled into a ball while my GF fell on the floor and laughed harder than I've ever seen anyone laugh in my entire life. Needless to say, that was the last time that I ever hit her with The Goat."	20	1590014486.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gnbmlg/men_whats_the_stupidest_way_youve_hurt_your_balls/fra9sx8/	0

I was around 19 and was dating this woman. She was older (36 at the time) and was a damn freak in bed. I was in heaven! So, one day we were having sex and she was on top grinding me into bliss when i realized it felt too good and I was close to finishing. I wanted to keep going so, while she was grinding me, i flicked my balls in hopes that it would just kinda sting and keep my mind occupied so i can keep going. 

Well, I am a classical guitarist. For those that don't know, we have our fingernails grown on our picking hand and file the nail in a specific way for sound. Well, I used that hand and, well, kinda missed, and more sliced my balls with the nail.

Men, what’s the stupidest way you’ve hurt your balls?		t5_2qh1i	"I needed to clean the mats in my car, and vacuuming them wasn’t doing the trick. We had a clothes line in the back yard so I thought “I’ve seen people put rugs over a clothes line and hit them with sticks to get the dust out” and figured it would work just as well... I hung that bad boy over the clothes line and started hitting it with a nice solid (and knobby) stick I found on the ground. I was hacking away. Left, right, left, right, wax on wax off... dust was flying all over, I was coughing up a storm. I decided to go in for some vertical strikes to even out the cleaning process, and after the first one the mat began to slide off the clothes line (I didn’t notice I was blood lusted). So of course the finale, I went for a final vertical whack and the stars aligned and the mat fell off the clothes line, I missed it, and smashed my nuts wicked hard with a knobby stick. That was DEFINITELY simultaneously the most pain and shame I have ever felt in one go. 0/10 do not recommend.

So we had to do a backflip on it, but I'm terrible at things like that so I was stuck halfway, the teacher, which was a woman, said she'd help and she tried to push me through. My balls got squashed between the iron bar and my stomach.

I couldn't ride a bike for 3 days and it's the first and only time in my life I've seen actual blue balls.

Linemen have to climb with a saftey strap, called a bucksqueeze that completely wraps the pole and then attaches to your belt, and a secondary saftey that just loops around the back of the pole. I had already spent more than an hour on this pole in the rain and was on my way down. There was a sign nailed up that I had to work my bucksqueeze underneath to get down the pole. While unhooking my secondary from the top of the sign, my hooks slid down the pole until the squeeze caught and I came to a stop. Unfortunately coming to a stop meant smashing my testicles against this pole. I hung up there for a good few minutes waiting for the my vision and breath to come back and finally got my ass down to detach.

Men, what’s the stupidest way you’ve hurt your balls?		t5_2qh1i	Like 10 years ago, back in primary school when the end of term was approaching, the teacher took the whole class to a sort of improvised lost-and-found office in the corridor, so the kids can find their lost stuff before the holiday starts. Bunch of my friends found a shoulder pad and one of them somehow figured out that it can be used as a jockstrap (you get a lot of weird ideas when you're ten). I didn't really participate in that too much, guess it wasn't my thing to put someone else's shoulder pad in my pants, however one of my buddies obviously didn't realize. He walked to me and casually kicked me in the balls assuming that I was the one with the protection equipped.

I racked my giggle-berries into my throat, and fell comically slowly sideways off the bike and into a fetal position on the floor. I couldn't make a sound. My friend's laughter ringing in my ears.

Men, what’s the stupidest way you’ve hurt your balls?		t5_2qh1i	"Oh man. I used to have a bottle of the final answer. Basically pure extract. Add a drop and that's all the heat you need for a gallon. Used it on chicken drop per breast great stuff. I wasn't stupid I always wore a glove when using, and that wound up being the problem. I just used the same glove every time I didn't put the cap on all the way so a bit spilled. Thought the glove caught it all didn't realize it coated the bottom and dried to my can of old bay.  So I'm making my chicken didn't feel like any heat but pan-seared old bay almost blackened that's a jam. Cooking my chicken, got my rice going and my chest starts burning. These giant angry like tiger welts are rising up. I'm like fuck I'm having an allergic reaction to something. Then my dick and balls start heating up. And heating up, and heating up. Just those areas so it's something I touched I'm looking around the kitchen thinking did I not wash something an this is a cleaning product I need to know how I need to clean this off. Dawns on my the old bay were next to the final solution, I cleaned everything but never thought to look at the can. I tried a cold shower. Made everything freezing but my chest and balls. Ended up bowlegged walking to the grocery store for milk, cream, yogurt. Spent an hour just splashing dairy and swilling dairy on my nuts in the shower. 

Forgot to clean the can after all that so a month later I ended up in the same place."	4	1589996159.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gnbmlg/men_whats_the_stupidest_way_youve_hurt_your_balls/fr9ebdx/	0

So he has not had a very good sense of space. My aunt said that when the dog was new to the household, he would keep bumping into her, if not knocking her over because he's such a big dog. When I went to their house, he had been there a while, so it wasn't as bad but a few times I got hit down there with that absolute tree branch of a tail.	9	1590005383.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gnbmlg/men_whats_the_stupidest_way_youve_hurt_your_balls/fr9xrt5/	0

An important thing to note about my dog is that he's missing a leg, so his jumping game isn't very strong. It's strong enough, though, to bring his paws to level with my balls.

My dog fucking punches me in the nuts.

Men, what’s the stupidest way you’ve hurt your balls?		t5_2qh1i	"A classmate in highschool was riding his bicycle and trying to do some stunts. He was running up to this mound of dirt he wanted to jump, but the mound was so improvised and so shit that the front wheel of the bike got stuck at the very bottom instead of going up, having him slid from the seat and hit his crotch real hard. He told us that it hurt real bad, but he continued riding for a little while until it started to sting. He went home, got to check himself in the bathroom and saw that his balls were out of his sac, plus a little blood running down his legs. 

We didn't understand what had happened to him, because somehow professors and school staff could not agree on an excuse to tell us why was he missing school (we were told that he had an accidente on a cab, but some were saying he was in the cab, others that he was hit by a cab, others that he had hurt his head, or broken a leg). Long story short, another classmate went to his house and was told by his brother that he was in the hospital because he had hurt his testicules. I got the full story when he came back to class.

Kid gets on one of those home benches with a quad extension rack on the end of it that has the long pole to load olympic sized weights.

It was at this time that his host mother walked back into the kitchen and saw him balls deep in her Yoplait. My favorite part is that he had to try to explain the situation using his Spanish, which at that time was very poor.

I'll admit im a hard ass and if you didn't know me,  I come off as hard or an asshole. After all im 6'2ft tall. Bearded and bulky as fuck. With tattoos And the male equivalent of resting bitch face that my co workers call ""resting murder face"". But in reality. I just really want to hug someone. I really do want to cuddle all the damn time. One of my favorite compliments I've ever received were about my eyes. But we are stuck in a world where if you are a guy, we are not allowed to ask for hugs. Or to hold or be held by someone. We don't get compliments like girls do. The most we get is ""good job."" "" it looks good."" Etc. So yes. We really are starved for any form of attention or contact. 
   Again. I'm 6'2ft. Bearded. Tattooed. Look like I want to strangle you with your child's intestines just for looking in my direction. But a secret about me?

Men of reddit, what compliment would you like to hear more often ?		t5_2qh1i	Any kind of compliment with actual meaning to it. Like whenever you get a compliment from a family member or something saying you look handsome or you did a good job at something, it doesn’t really affect you because they’re your family and they have to compliment you. But when someone like your friend or even a stranger compliments on a specific thing that shows that they actually care, it really hits home dude. (like them saying they like how your eyes look rather than you look “handsome” is so much more impactful because you know it’s genuine cause they took the time to examine your face and concluded that they like that one feature, and they didn’t have to tell you they liked that feature but they felt like they needed to, that feels good. But lazily saying that you generally look “good” doesn’t feel as genuine because it’s just summing up your appearance into a single word without taking a chance to admire any part of you at all)	2	1590000440.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gneapa/men_of_reddit_what_compliment_would_you_like_to/fr9n8iy/	1

On the shuttle bus she realised that we lived in the same the area and my mate suggested we should catch the train together so we did. It was at night and she told me halfway that she feels comfortable and safe with me sitting next to each other comparing with other of her guy mates. I was surprised since we pretty much just met each other early that day and that felt good hahaha.

If she doesn't love history, mechanics, and/or music, and she doesn't have the excuse of being into literature and language or some form of art, she's probably just into cosmetics and clothes and nothing could be more draining for your interests and energy. Girls into cosmetics and stuff have their own style and way to go, and it's not even a little bit a bad thing (one of my best friends is a genius with makeup and she has taught me all I know), but trust me when I say girls exist who love what you love. In fact, after all that, I can genuinely say as a history buff and a musician, it's awesome that you know that stuff so well. 😁	4	1590008750.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gneapa/men_of_reddit_what_compliment_would_you_like_to/fra4vyc/	0

If you’ve ever asked the universe for some kind of sign and got it clear as day, what was it and how did it go?		t5_2qh1i	"When my mom died, I was pretty destroyed. We were very close. I was feeling like I couldn't understand how to live in the world without her. One day I was driving home from work, depressed as hell, and I started thinking how much I'd love it if I could get a sign from her - surprising myself a bit, as I'm not at all religious, and am highly skeptical about things like signs from the universe. But I missed her so much that I mentally asked the universe for a sign. 

She really loved birds, so I thought, wouldn't it be cool if it came in the form of a bird. Maybe a sparrow or even a pigeon or something.

I got home, parked my car, and walked up the path to the cottage I was renting (this was in the city of Berkeley, CA). As I was unlocking the front door, off to the side a flash of color caught my eye. I turned to look, and it was a Chinese pheasant. I had no idea what it was, I had to look it up, but if you Google Chinese pheasants, you'll see why I was so blown away. It was brilliantly colored, with gold on its head and back, orange and black bars on its neck, bright red chest and blue on its wings - the most psychedelic bird I've ever seen. And it was standing on my front porch, a bird native to fucking China. I had no clue how the hell it COULD even be there. I thought I had to be dreaming, so I got my neighbor to come see it. We stared at it with our jaws hanging open. Then it sort of squawked and flew away.

And it hit me, that I had asked my mom / the universe for a sign, thinking maybe a drab little sparrow or a pigeon - and what I got was a bird that was ridiculously over the top, and it was exactly the kind of joke my mom would have loved. 

I'm still skeptical and not religious and don't believe in fairies and shit, but... that was weird, and also great."	8903	1589972161.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gn62cf/if_youve_ever_asked_the_universe_for_some_kind_of/fr897tu/	7
If you’ve ever asked the universe for some kind of sign and got it clear as day, what was it and how did it go?		t5_2qh1i	"I was in the depths of despair, I had lost my great job, had to travel 2hrs everyday with heavy tools each way to a temporary job I was doing. Sitting on the bus, thinking my world was over and it all kind of got to me all at once and I began to tear up, not wanting to ball my eyes out in public I held it in. So I asked for something anything that could show me that life wasn't worthless. 

A lady I didn't see must have how bad I was or maybe it was just coincidence but just after I cried out in my head. I heard the words "" Everything is going to be ok""

It saved my life.

Edit: I had no idea that this would affect you all so much. Sometimes it might be dark and a small spark starts a fire. Sometimes you're the small spark.

If you’ve ever asked the universe for some kind of sign and got it clear as day, what was it and how did it go?		t5_2qh1i	"I’m not superstitious at all, but my uncle is. When my Nan passed he went to see a fortune teller who told him that anytime our family sees white feathers around, that’s Nans way of showing us that she’s there. I thought it was a load of bullshit and forgot about it. 

A few years later I was at a music festival. Everything was coated in dirt and dust being churned up by thousands of people’s feet. Even the air was so thick with dust it was making it hard to see and breathe. I was on the edges of the mosh pit when I started to have my first panic attack. I’d never had one before, didn’t know what was happening to me and I was terrified. I felt like I was being crushed and like I was the only person in the world at the same time. I remember desperately thinking ‘I don’t want to be alone, I don’t want to be here alone’ I crouched down in the middle of the dirty dusty crown and when I opened my eyes there was a single white feather on the ground right between my feet. It was perfectly white, no dirt, not stepped on or anything- in a mosh pit. I stared at the feather until I could get my breathing under control and get out of there and I still have that feather."	5085	1589969217.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gn62cf/if_youve_ever_asked_the_universe_for_some_kind_of/fr867ku/	5
If you’ve ever asked the universe for some kind of sign and got it clear as day, what was it and how did it go?		t5_2qh1i	"This wasn’t really asking for a “sign,” but I was going through a lot and in a really shitty and dark place, like the kind of place I honestly wasn’t sure I’d survive. I was teetering on the edge of despair and genuinely going down the path towards doing something insanely drastic. I basically just asked the universe for help one day while in the middle of another crying episode and I had this strange, sunny feeling kind of leak into the darkness I was harboring inside of me.

The next day, by chance, I met my group of friends on a video game I played regularly at the time. They lived in an entirely different city and had entirely different lives from me but we all just... clicked. It took a month or two for me to settle into that friendship and understand that they were gonna stick around, and they’ve been my best friends for three years now. Some of my best memories are from that first summer that I knew them.

I genuinely don’t think I would have survived that time in my life had I not met them. I was feeling incredibly alone and I was trying to come to terms with a lot of things all at once. I’m infinitely grateful for them, and I can’t help but think that the universe was listening that day when, as a last ditch effort, I asked it for help."	9232	1589963981.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gn62cf/if_youve_ever_asked_the_universe_for_some_kind_of/fr813dl/	2

I was exhausted all the time. My stepmom and I were very religious for a long time but I was starting to question my faith and stopped making church a priority. This caused a lot of drama (and I think resentment) from her and my father who worked out of the country. 

While attending cosmetology school I had made friends and was so starved for any sort of friendship and I guess even affection I would tell them the things I hated about my home life. They helped me start to see how toxic my parents and situation was. I knew I had to move out.
I tried to do so amicably but to no avail. In fact my attempts to leave peacefully backfired and caused more problems. 

At the time, being religous, I prayed for a way out. But my prayers rarely were answered so I grew hopeless. A few weeks later after a rough few days between me and my stepmom things came to a head one night and she called my father. 

They had threanted for years to kick me out. ( I was a seriously well behaved kid so I was always the one to apologize for whatever they thought I did that was so horrible.) This particular night when the threat entered the air, I saw it as a sign and a fleeting opportunity. I packed my things and was gone the next day. 

It's been 4 years and I am now living in a different state with my husband and daughter and our second child is due to be born in about a month."	3089	1589964678.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gn62cf/if_youve_ever_asked_the_universe_for_some_kind_of/fr81snj/	1

If you’ve ever asked the universe for some kind of sign and got it clear as day, what was it and how did it go?		t5_2qh1i	"I had asked the universe for a sign of good and friendly people really existing out in this world. I know, it's kinda stupid but I have struggled with making friends that weren't toxic, and I felt like I just wasn't destined to have great friends.

About two days after I had asked for a sign, I went to my local park to do my daily routine of sitting down, smoking my cigarettes and reading and for some strange reason, a pair of strangers came up to me and introduced themselves.

We ended up talking with each other for what felt like hours and eventually, I had asked them why they came up to me and the guy said 'oh, we made a deal to see if we could make any new friends and we did. You're a new friend!' After, we all walked and got some cookies and ice cream and chilled again, by the river this time.

They both are now my closest friends, and it all started because I was at the right place, and at the right time for them to come up to me. I strongly believe that it was the universe's doing and am so grateful for it.

Edit: I’ve had some questions about how exactly i attracted my friends. I changed my thoughts and my feelings about myself and those around me. i began to become a more happier version of myself and thought of myself as a fun and happy person. i also began to feel the emotions of gratitude and happiness and i would thank the universe for all the good things in me life. Remember! your thoughts and feelings are what create your future and the universe knows nothing more but to attract to you what you attract to it! i hope this helps!!! 

Edit 2: i have told my friends about me asking the universe for new friends that would support and love me regardless, and they said that they had in a way done the same thing. My friends had wanted to make new friends for a while, they had actually made a deal that they would go up and try and make friends. it just happened to be that i was the first person they met and ended up being the person they had hoped to met! I guess, all i can say is just have belief and faith in the universe, don’t worry about how you will make the friends you want, just believe that you already have them in your life and they will come. By asking for a sign, your almost daring the universe to show that it is really looking out for you and the universe will always respond, just in a way that you won’t expect!!

If you’ve ever asked the universe for some kind of sign and got it clear as day, what was it and how did it go?		t5_2qh1i	"At 13 years old, I was being molested by my teacher and was scared as fuck on what he'd do to me if I ever tell anyone. I feared going to school everyday and wanted to stay away from him as much as possible, even though I have to or else my grades will drop. So every time he calls for me, I wished the whole universe will save me from this traumatic experience.

One morning, the school chose the few thriving students to attend an awareness program about drugs, sexual abuse, and kidnapping since 7th graders will almost be in high school. I didn't know then what was the program about, but if it gets me away from school, I happily went with my classmates. I listened to all the videos and itade my eyes wide open as I watched a video about a young boy being seduced by an older guy and he molested him. He talked to his parents about it and the predator was arrested months later.

I silently had a mental breakdown after what I saw. And when I went home, I told my family everything.

Years later after therapy and medication from PSTD and depression, I'm currently happy with my new school and being on the top of the class again. Needless to say that the teacher was guilty for sexual abuse of many female students after families of that school rallied together to get the man arrest, including mine.

I didn’t believe it was him so I even checked the fuse box. I almost called an electrician but for some reason I couldn’t bring myself to do it. It was just the lights, the power points still worked so I could cook and the fridge was on. It stayed that way for two days until I eventually said ok ok I know it’s you and they came back on. I was so overwhelmed with grief at the time this seemed like nothing but now I see how crazy it was. I get this might be hard for some people to believe but I really don’t care if anyone believes it or not, I just needed to know he was somewhere else besides in the ground because he was only in his 20’s and it just wasn’t fair he was gone so young.

I had never seen an ambulance on the highway that didn’t have its signal going and immediately broke down and cried, the ambulance was just cruising behind me.

It talked about the universe reflecting your thoughts, words and actions directly back at you. I.e. Wanting a career change results in a reality of wanting a career change.

There was a message about Being and not Doing. So I wanted to test this with an experiment, as it all sounded a bit mumbo jumbo. So I volunteered in a special needs youth club...so I could Be and give what I wanted the universe to reflect back at me.

This led to a job as a support worker for special needs in a college, which led to completing a Distance learning Degree, which led to teacher training, which led to being a graduate lecturer, which led to deputy management of a whole faculty and ultimately a career helping 100s of people each year.

I have continued to practice this Creating your own reality philosophy of Being through thoughts, speech and actions. The number of times it works cannot be just luck. Believing in luck is just as far fetched if you really think about it.

I liked to go on long walks, just around the city or down by the lake, maybe through a park. Just be by myself thinking about life and what to do next. I'd talk with myself, have conversations with the universe. I'd ask, ""Do I really have a shot at pulling my life together? Everything is so messed up. Will I find some meaning? Some direction? Or am I cursed to just wander lost till I'm eventually hit by a car or struck by lightning or caught in a fire? If that's my fate why not get it over with, either that or give me some hope to believe in."" Well a few weeks later I got my answer. I was hit by a car."	454	1589961672.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gn62cf/if_youve_ever_asked_the_universe_for_some_kind_of/fr7yr8g/	3
If you’ve ever asked the universe for some kind of sign and got it clear as day, what was it and how did it go?		t5_2qh1i	"One day, I was at my schools robotics team building session after school. There was this freshman, who I didn’t know prior to this event (and who I will call X from here on), is sitting on the stairs talking with someone on the phone. I only walked by, but I could tell that X was getting very emotional and frustrated with the person on the phone, to the point tears were coming down their face. I continue on my way to go and grab my computer, which was in a room down the hall from the stairs, and when I returned X was just sitting there. I asked X if they were okay and if they needed someone to talk to, X said no, and went away to the workshop area where the robot was. Later, one of the teachers who runs the program, needed a couple of people to brainstorm and design some of the different functions of the robot. X, 1 or 2 friends of my friends, and I volunteer. We go to this room, and we all start talking, all of us except for X. My friends go out of the room to grab some supplies to start modeling our designs, and in their absences I once again ask X if they are okay. After a couple of seconds, X says no, and they start talking about how their stepfather is abusive, and how their mom doesn’t do anything to stop it. Once they were done talking, and after us just talking about life, I give X my SnapChat so that if they ever need to talk to someone without judgement, they could confide in me. I usually never do this, and at the time I found it was weird that I was doing so. After my friends return and we do a bit of designing, I had to leave and go to a soccer practice, as I have soccer practice and robotics meetings on the same night

After a mostly boring practice, I returned home and grabbed my phone and turned it on to see that I had just received a message from X. I open the message and it says, “I’m committing suicide”. At this point I freak out, and show my parents. I had basically just met X and they were telling me this? My parents called 911, as I start messaging X trying to figure out where they were, and if they were with anyone. After getting the police and ambulance to their house, X was taken to the hospital and was being treated (the dispatcher called us back to tell us all of this). The next day, I went to school and I found out that X had tried to overdose on prescription medications. X had already taken the drugs when EMS arrived. 

This whole series of events made me think of how the universe helped me save a life. I didn’t know X , I hadn’t had a conversation with them before, I never asked to be apart of this, but I was. 

I know this didn’t answer correctly, but it was a sign the universe gave. Also I am sorry for any misuse of grammar or weird wording anywhere, it is hard to recount all of the details from that night, and It’s been hard for me to write down everything that happened. 

TL;DR Universe set me up to save a person from committing suicide.

Edit: Besides a couple of lung issues that are treatable, X is doing good. We talk just about every day now, and become good friends. 

Also, thank you to every one who took the time to read, and to any one who it may effect, if you are ever in need of help, no matter how serious, there will always be someone for you to talk to, you don’t need to fight your battles alone."	643	1589967353.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gn62cf/if_youve_ever_asked_the_universe_for_some_kind_of/fr84e65/	3

She was amazing and loved all animals. She dreamed and hoped to have a farm where all animals could come and live out their lives, the only cost to them would be allowing a pet or a scratch from her.  Brain cancer had its own ideas. Saddled with the bills after she died, my dad and I couldn't afford to buy her ashes from the funeral home. Her side of the family bought them and scattered them in a nearby park with a pond. I found out months later. They didn't even bother to call me. I went there and begged God for a sign. Immediately after I looked down and saw a duck, obviously dead and half submerged in the frozen water. The duck's feathers were beautiful, but it was a dead as can be, its eyes white and glazed. The feeling I got was that death is final, and there's no real coming to terms with it. That was thirty seven years ago and I've never asked for a sign since.	155	1589969275.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gn62cf/if_youve_ever_asked_the_universe_for_some_kind_of/fr869q3/	3

If you’ve ever asked the universe for some kind of sign and got it clear as day, what was it and how did it go?		t5_2qh1i	"About a year ago I was without a steady job and tackling work as a background actor (finding work can be inconsistent and as a non-union the pay isn't top-tier). It was fine as acting is really the career I want to be in, but what wasn't fine was the instability. I only had so much money for my bills and expenditures, constantly on the brink of broke, had credit card debt, all that financial misery. 

Before that I was working in manufacturing warehouses, which was steady and simple. However, it was absolutely miserable work to me. Tedious handiwork, constant standing & lifting of heavy things, being scrutinized every day even when doing above-and-beyond, and absolutely no free time. I'd left that work behind when I chose to finally take acting, but the financial hardship was starting to drive me back to the stability of full-time jobs grudgingly. 

I had one job lined up as a warehouse employee again and was finishing up a call with a representative to start the onboarding process. All that time while i was on the phone I was just thinking about the monotony of this line of work, and the fact that if I took the job I'd turn my back on what I really wanted to do, and could possibly be stuck in a dead-end job. It got me thinking to myself about the good times I'd had working on different sets, going to far out areas I'd never been to, and the happiness I got from jobs I actually enjoyed. When I came out of it, I thought to myself, ""You know what, I'll take the job if I have to, but if I get a call for even just one background job, I'm just gonna stick out the waiting."" (This was during the end of the dry season of filming)

Not even 10 minutes later I got a call for not one but multi-day jobs. Enough to not only keep me stable but get me above the debts I was getting in.

So I declined the warehouse job, stuck with acting, worked at it with a more determined mindset, and by the end of the year I was able to join a union with no more debt and more stability than where I was at the year before

TL:DR; ""Starving artist"" debates returning to warehouse job, sticks with acting and gets good with it"	202	1589967821.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gn62cf/if_youve_ever_asked_the_universe_for_some_kind_of/fr84ucm/	0

So, when succulents became the craze, I bought a few. I panicked because they weren’t happy and overwatered all of them. The pots I had didn’t have proper drainage either. The poor things all drowned. Around the same time, changes were made at work (nursing home) that made it very hard to properly care for everyone. One of the people affected was Flash Gordon (not his real name) he was dying, and he was my friend. He made me promise not to quit until after he died as I was the only one patient enough with his grumpy ass. When he passed I couldn’t stop crying at work. Someone grabbed this little guy from his room and began overwatering it at the nurses station. I then decided that since I couldn’t save Flash, I’d save the succulent. 

Almost a year passes, I’ve stayed and kept all my promises, but I’m miserable. Administration doesn’t do shit, and people are suffering. I’m no longer effective because my mental health is severely suffering. I didn’t want to abandon them, and I was ready to set myself ablaze to keep em warm. Finally, I asked the universe for a sign that I should leave. The next morning I wake up and this little guy had a huge stalk I apparently hadn’t noticed. There were blossoms all throughout. A tear ran down my cheek, I thanked Flash, and put in my two weeks.

One morning just before class started a friend of mine walked past and even tho I was usually super paranoid about being late to class I stopped him and talked to him for a bit. Turns out he had just that morning broken up with his girlfriend, who none of us knew was very cruel and manipulative. He had been with her for years and it took a lot for him to do that.

As I began networking with people in Cali, I started to get very weird vibes about moving. Some were suggesting I shouldn’t at all due to the high costs, while others were Encouraging it but maybe didn’t have judgment I trusted. Other things were contributing, but I was feeling very strange about it - hard to explain. It just didn’t quite feel right.

During my last week at the rental, I asked the universe to send a definite sign on whether or not I should go.

On Aug 27, I completely cleared out my car so I could begin moving boxes to my parents house who lived about 40 miles north. That night around 2 am, I was packing in the living room, when suddenly I heard my car start up outside (it had a very distinctive start-up sound, so I knew it was mine). I ran to the front door and opened it just in time to see my car finish backing out and driving away. The car was found a few days later totaled in the city. 

It was never clear how the thief started the vehicle, since I still had the keys and no wiring had been messed with; it was surmised by police that he’d had a skeleton key for that make and model (perhaps it was the teenage son of an auto dealer or something). Anyway, I got a full insurance payout on the vehicle.

Other damage to my things were minimal, as the car had been completely cleared out for moving. While the event itself was very frustrating and even a little traumatic, to me, that felt clear as day to be a sign that I wasn’t supposed to go to L.A.

I was riding my bike the first sunny day of last month. I loved bike rides feeling the wind in my hair and honestly feeling like I'm on top of the world. 

love for me has always been taboo and honestly was starting to not believe it. the sun hit my face just right and closed my eyes and made the wish for a sign of actual love...

best mistake of my life was closing my eyes while riding my bike.

as I opened my eyes very shortly after, I ran into this very pretty girl riding her bike. we both flew off and hit the grass as soon as it happened. we both looked at each other and just stared. good 5s passed before she grimaced. 

her ankle looked broke but wasn't sure. I ended up calling the ambulance and ended up talking with her waiting for the ambulance finding out we had a lot in common and me bewildered how she was so strong. 

ambulance came and she gave me her number as well as her father's. I called up her dad and he came and picked me up with the bikes. I was dropped off home and I hit her up asking for the verdict on her ankle. it was dislocated with possible ligament issues that she has to wear a boot for awhile. 

well, cutting to the chase we ended up dating after it all and honestly the happiest and seemingly healthiest relationship I've ever been in.

The country I was in, you couldn't drink the water. But one night I wasn't thinking and brushed my teeth with tap water.

So we're all standing in a circle holding hands, and the first of my Montezuma's Revenge farts slips out... and it was RANK. Deadly, but silent - nobody knew it was me. 

My dad smells it (remember we're in a cave - the fart has nowhere to escape to, we have to just marinate in it) and gets SUPER excited. ""The bible says an exorcised spirit will leave behind the smell of brimstone! We really accomplished something here today!""

I’ve always had a deep deep love for Frida Kahlo - it’s my DREAM to see a full exhibition of hers - and love one of her quotes in particular: “podemos aguantar mucho más de lo que pensamos que podemos” (we can endure much more than what we think we can) and used this quote to remind myself everything will be okay.  

Anyway, so here I was, sad and alone in a big city looking for any reason not to get on a plane and head straight home and give it all up. One day I’m thinking of this Frida quote and wander into an art museum that I hadn’t visited before to take my mind off how low I was feeling. I walk inside and what do I see right in the middle of the art gallery wall?

Not sure how legit it is but it sounds like it could be. However my depression makes me feel like doing anything that requires a modicum of effort to be impossible. I just end up coming up with a million excuses as to why it won’t make a difference and never do it. 

Anyway, crying at all these comments and feeling like shit, my TV is on in the background and I just randomly hear this one line “Take action now and get the help you need.” Okay, fine! Set an alarm for tomorrow to set up a therapy appointment. Hoping it goes well and I can get back on my medication :)"	54	1589972952.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gn62cf/if_youve_ever_asked_the_universe_for_some_kind_of/fr8a1ll/	0
If you’ve ever asked the universe for some kind of sign and got it clear as day, what was it and how did it go?		t5_2qh1i	"Twenty years ago I was married to very abusive man. (all sociopathic psychopath symptoms). My husband left the house, my child 2 years old at the time was napping. I had mental breakdown, deep inside, quietly to do not wake my son up... I took the razor, I put it next to my wrist... And my son came to me... I took my son andI left my husband a couple weeks later. 
Now, happy married to an amazing man. My son is living with us, both my men are going well together, we have beautiful old house with a massive garden and happy as never before."	113	1589967138.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gn62cf/if_youve_ever_asked_the_universe_for_some_kind_of/fr846qu/	0
If you’ve ever asked the universe for some kind of sign and got it clear as day, what was it and how did it go?		t5_2qh1i	"Late to the party, but here it goes. 

Back story, when I was 7 years old my Dad suffered a debilitating stroke. He went from a well spoken and locally famous attorney to a recluse who couldn’t talk well and had trouble walking. I would come to learn later that he battled suicidal thoughts during the first year of his recovery. Anyways, growing up I could never do fun physical activities with my dad and started to forget some of my memories of him being active. All of our home movies he was the one recording so I couldn’t really watch him be himself there. But there was this one video, one of those old male your own music video tapes, of him and my uncle singing the old Bobby Darren song ‘Mac the Knife.’  I used to watch it all the time. He was happy and singing and laughing and dancing. Things he never was anymore. I loved that video. It helped me get through some times of heavy self pity. 

Fast forward 20 years. I am about to go under the knife for an albeit minor surgery, but I need to be awake and have declined all pain management, as I cannot take any of those types of medication. They told me how important it was to stay calm, but I was nervous. As I was wheeled in to the OR, I prayed/asked the universe/released myself whatever you wanna call it. They get me on the table and on cue the surgeons small radio starts up with Mac the Knife. A song I have never, ever heard on the radio. I was so shocked I forgot everything, tears just streamed down my face, and by the time the song was over I was the most calm I have ever been. Even writing about it now makes me tear up."	48	1589977897.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gn62cf/if_youve_ever_asked_the_universe_for_some_kind_of/fr8g08n/	0

My mom has always been there for every surgery I've ever had, with the exception of this last one in November. You see, she passed away from pancreatic cancer not quite two & a half years ago. I screamed out to what others perceived as an empty room. I screamed to my mother I needed her, that I missed her and that I couldn't go through this experience without her. I distinctly and clearly heard the sound of Crystal Bells being chimed (mama had collected bells for 45 years). I smelled white shoulders perfume, as if I was wearing it right under my own nose (it was the only one that woman ever wore). I knew without a doubt that she had heard me and with the grace, mercy, and unconditional love that transcends time and space between a mother and daughter, she came to be with me.

I used to be addicted to ice tea when I was a teenager. I'd buy soluble ice tea and drink about 6 liters (1.6 gallons) of it every day. I knew it wasn't doing any good to my teeth and kidneys, but I couldn't help it. So, one night I was walking home through a silent, deserted downtown. I was thinking about finally getting healthy drinking habits and I asked myself ""Should I stop drinking ice tea?"". I looked up and on the building in front of me there was a single big neon sign spelling ""Siva"", but only the first two letters were lit, spelling ""yes"" in Italian.

I quit my ice tea habit a year or so later. This comment was typed while sipping my second Monster Energy Drink of the day."	39	1589969477.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gn62cf/if_youve_ever_asked_the_universe_for_some_kind_of/fr86h3g/	1

If you’ve ever asked the universe for some kind of sign and got it clear as day, what was it and how did it go?		t5_2qh1i	"My buddy got out of jail and I let him stay with me for a bit, but told him he needed to find a new place in a couple weeks.  He was recently sober so I was trying to help him out.  His recent sobriety caused a bunch of mental issues for him to come up to the point that it made me very uncomfortable although it was pretty innocent and he wasn't dangerous to me or anyone.  Just some temporary delusions and schizophrenia or something.

For example, I am a software engineer and he recently realized he was gay and he thought I had somehow programmed his brain to be gay for me.  Anyways.  I kicked him out when the two weeks were up.  Fastforward a couple of days and I get back home and there he is mowing my lawn.  Instead of being understanding I exploded on him and told him to fuck off and leave me alone.  He left.

Fast forward a week.  I got a new job that he had no idea I had and it was about an hour drive from my house so well out of the way.  I pull up to the gas station near my work and I see him sitting in a car with someone, high out of his mind.  Too high to notice me even standing right in front of the car.

I feel like it was the universes way of telling me to be kind because In a way I caused him to relapse when I exploded on him.  He and I are still best friends to this day.  He still struggles with drugs but his brain isn't quite so crazy anymore.  Haven't heard from him for a couple weeks and I really hope he is doing alright.  


For the record this happened a couple years ago and he and I have basically been friends since high school so 20+ years.  We've known each other long enough that his his siblings introduce me as their brother and his mom and dad introduce me as their son to people.  It was just a weird time for him that made me highly uncomfortable and I feel like it was just trying to show me why its important to be understanding."	49	1589968321.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gn62cf/if_youve_ever_asked_the_universe_for_some_kind_of/fr85bpb/	0

I was at a church camp when I was 17, which is in my church the age where you can have your confirmation if you feel ready. I had just found out I was bi and I also just started at a new school. Overall it was a messy time. At that camp I had a really weird experience in the middle of the night while stargazing that felt as if someone was talking to me saying He wanted me to be His child. It was very powerful and overwhelming, and I answered by saying I wanted to give my life to Him. Then when I came home and checked my 'Bible verse of the day' diary, the text of the day where that happened said ""so then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live your lives with him"". Which made it clear as day to me that no matter who I was or what I felt like, I was still loved and wanted and valid. Later that year I came out to my preacher and he was super supportive of me being bi, and a statement was released in church that we love everyone no matter their sexual orientation or how they chose to express it. I had my confirmation 6 months later and I still try and help show that being queer and Christian absolutely can go hand in hand, and that we should love and not judge."	45	1589975667.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gn62cf/if_youve_ever_asked_the_universe_for_some_kind_of/fr8d446/	0

At this time, I was at a conference of about 40,000 people for a  few days. I was getting overwhelmed as I was around so many people, so I broke away from my friends. 

I went outside to get some air and a face-full of snow. All I could think about was my sister. I asked the universe, God, somebody, anybody- for a sign that my sister would live and be ok. I asked for an orange rose. If I got to see an orange rose before the conference ended, I would know she would be ok.

Standing outside a packed hotel on a busy city street in winter, my expectations were low. So I put my name-tag back on and went inside. I went to the main room that was packed with 40k people to try to go back to where I left my friends. 

While shoving through people, out of the corner of my eye, I saw the word ""Rose"". My eyes snapped to the source of the stray word, and I saw a girl with bright orange hair and a name-tag that read, ""Rose"".

The orange rose.

Started having feelings for my best friend of many years, got physical, but I was too afraid too pursue something more.
I live in London and he lives in Athens.

One day he calls me saying he got a letter that he has to be presented for his army training (in Greece army training is 9 months, and is mandatory for all men, but if you are in university you can postpone it. He had forgotten to send his university’s proof of studying. It was extremely unlikely he could do something about it because it was Friday amd he had to be presented in a Greek island, on Monday.). 
I freaked out that I will lose him forever but I was too afraid to do anything.
Before I went to sleep I said that if he manages to postpone it, I will tell him how I feel and try to put my fears aside. Not just with him, but in my life in general.

Next morning he calls me to tell me he did it. I blurted out that I was in love with him. He booked tickets the same day to come to London. We just had our 2 year anniversary and I’ve been happier than ever, and feel much better in most aspects of my life (with his help/support)

If you’ve ever asked the universe for some kind of sign and got it clear as day, what was it and how did it go?		t5_2qh1i	"This might be a long slog but please stick with it, I think it’s a great story and it truly changed my life

I struggle with my mental health and a couple of years ago when I first discovered I had issues had a proper breakdown. Although I had been depressed for a long time, I was starting to become suicidal. I didn’t feel attached to life anymore or anyone involved in it. I was convinced all my feelings where a product of society though (spoiler alert they weren’t) and that if I removed myself from the 9-5 and lived “freely” I would be a lot more at peace. So, I took a sabbatical and decided to travel Australia for a year, largely because I hadn’t done any long term travelling before and there would be no language barrier.

I started off in Melbourne loved the city but was still felt no better. I had a date with a Japanese girl during my time there, it didn’t go very well and I was disappointed. While sitting waiting for a tram another Japanese girl sat beside me, she picked up a little doll from the floor gave it to me and said she hadn’t seen one from a while it was from her home city. I took the doll and tried to make conversation, assuming she wanted to talk as she started a conversation. She didn’t really talk back though which I found unusual so I left her too it.

Fast forward 2 months I’ve attached the doll to my bag as I like little novelty things like that and am now working on an apple farm In Tasmania, I’m still depressed but starting to need the money. Meet my first friend there funnily enough a boy from Japan who recognises the doll and says it’s a famous thing and comes from the town across from his. I spend one day down by the beach, bump into a woman and get talking. She tells me that if I ever find myself in Hobart to contact her as often, they need backpackers to help out the community centre she works in. Fast forward a couple of weeks and the apple farm has ran out of apples and I need money. Still depressed I provide the universe with an ultimatum. A couple of the girls in the hostel mentioned how they hitchhiked up from Hobart. I decided if the Universe and through extension people care about me it will also look out for me by helping me get down to Hobart through hitchhiking, where I would hopefully find some bar work. 

I did hitchhike down it took a couple of hours before someone picked me up, but once they did they came in quick succession and I made it down on time to book in at my next hostel. To you that might seem like nothing but for me at that time and with the very low self-esteem I had to have people accept me in that way, despite me being a total stranger who through no fault of my own may not look the friendliest was overwhelming. It took 3 people to get down and I had 3 great conversations, especially with the last. She was a woman who started working in mental health after her son had taken his own life, after hearing this I felt comfortable explaining my story and why I was here. And in a way she seemed genuinely happy for me, almost as through her son she could see other young men addressing their issues and trying to make it work. She even offered to let me stay for the night but I declined.

Turns out I arrived in Winter and no one was needing any bar staff. So, I contacted the Woman at the beach who said she doesn’t need any work done but her friend might. I contacted her friend who said not long term but a backpacker had cancelled just before my message so she had a days work available. I went and worked in her garden for the day and we got on great she even invited me back on the Sunday, she was throwing a party and I handed out the snacks. I was in a remote area and my accent was a nice novelty for the guests.

No work was forthcoming still so I decided to gamble it all and try one last part of the country, worst case I’d see more of it before I had to leave. I contacted her asking if it was possible if I could spend one night there in order to save money before moving on. She instead asked if I would like to move in with her for a couple of months and she would pay me to work on her own little farm. I of course accepted. I really wasn’t much use if I’m honest, I was a city boy from a single parent home with no diy skills. And yet despite this she taught me how to do all the work she needed done and then paid me for it. Coming from my background as well healthy eating and cooking was never taught, and she taught and helped me to make far healthier meals again out of her own pocket, and we would eat together every night. All this while I wasn’t even paying rent. I often wondered why she was being so nice; she was a deeply spiritual person and believed in a Japanese religion I’d never heard of. She believed in reincarnation and karma and she told me at one point she believed maybe we met through a karmic debt she had to me in a past life. Which I wasn’t really on board with until little coincidences kept popping up for example. Our ancestors where from the same part of Ireland, our dogs both had the same very unusual name. And then less strange things like her having the same name as my own auntie and a little boy that came to visit her was the spitting image and shared the same name as my little brother back home. Later on, though I discovered her own partner had taking his own life due to depression and we shared the same name, that’s when I started to think maybe there was something too it.

As well as teaching me about diy and cooking she was also a great counsellor of sorts and helped me see a lot of things from a different angle. A lot of the issues I had which lead to poor mental health I was able to work through with her advice, I wasn’t completely cured but it did a wonder of good and I was able to call her for advice throughout my travels later on when I left the farm.

The thing that really sealed it for me though that the universe had my back, and this lady was introduced to me deliberately though came in my final week there. At the weekends she would drop me of in the City centre and I would do odd jobs for extra money. One day she noticed the little doll on my bag and asked about it. I told her the story and she took a photo to have her friend who speaks Japanese translate what its top said. And it turned out the doll was from the city her spiritual headquarters was based and a city she had visited many times and a place she had even booked up to go back to later this year. 

I know there might be nothing in it but a string of little coincidences but like I said I enjoy little novelties like that, and I truly felt like the Universe was looking out for me.

TLDR: I asked the universe to have my back and it did time and time again."	31	1589978681.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gn62cf/if_youve_ever_asked_the_universe_for_some_kind_of/fr8h3sm/	0
If you’ve ever asked the universe for some kind of sign and got it clear as day, what was it and how did it go?		t5_2qh1i	"I was 12 and suicidal. I couldn't see myself living another month.

My most suicidal months were March and April 2018. I had lost all hope and for me it wasn't a question of how, but when. My first attempt was in March. My brother's birthday was on April 5 and after my first attempt failed I told myself I was gonna wait until 2 weeks after his birthday, because I didn't want the anniversary of my death to be so close to a day he should enjoy.

My next and worst attempt was on April 15. 10 days after his birthday. It was so painful that it actually scared the shit out of me and that's why I didn't attempt to OD again. The thing is that I can remember how much of a hell living one more day was. If his birthday wasn't in April then I might have been dead right now.

Idk if it was a sign or not, but it saved my life. That's what matters."	40	1589967879.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gn62cf/if_youve_ever_asked_the_universe_for_some_kind_of/fr84waq/	0

If you’ve ever asked the universe for some kind of sign and got it clear as day, what was it and how did it go?		t5_2qh1i	I lost my father rather tragically a little over a year ago. On his death bed I told him I know he has to go to heaven but if it were possible for him to stick around for a little while I wouldn’t hate it. I’m not even religious or believe in any of that stuff but at the time it made sense. Boy did he show himself too. When my family met with a lawyer(friend of his) to go over his estate a lightbulb burnt out in the room which was perfectly timed. I started a side job working in carpentry after he passed and he would have absolutely loved that. He taught me all that stuff growing up and the first project I worked on was this really beautiful deck. I swear I saw him out of the corner of my eye at the site one day. Also, I ended up inheriting his car and one day I was cleaning it out and found a quarter under the seat. I always look to see if it’s my birth year and before I looked I said to myself ‘if this quarter is my birth year it’s a sign.’ Sure enough it was my birth year! Now that quarter lives in the cup holder forever. I dk if any of these signs are real or whatever but they sure are comforting. Losing people is tough. Nice to know we have some stuff to help us get through.	11	1589997756.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gn62cf/if_youve_ever_asked_the_universe_for_some_kind_of/fr9hmyn/	0

I was standing in my bedroom holding a bunch of narcotics in my hands. I stood there and went to put them in my mouth but paused and pleaded please give me a sign if I should just put the pills down and go to sleep and get some rest. At that moment a huge cruise ship in the bay near me blasted its horn in one long loud tone. This was around 2am and I had never heard the horn go off other than first thing in the morning and dinner/evening calls. Since then, anytime I feel like I’m on the edge of making that shitty choice, I tell myself “Just get some sleep.

If you’ve ever asked the universe for some kind of sign and got it clear as day, what was it and how did it go?		t5_2qh1i	"This is something that happens in my family. 

My Oma, my mother's mom, was the most wonderful lady you could imagine. And what was amazing was how wonderful she was coming from a childhood surviving WWII in the rural german countryside. This included not dying from starvation by foraging the forests for edible tubers, helping hide her family under the floorboards of their house to avoid both german and russian death and rape gangs, watching her father be killed in front of her by a nazi doctor forcing a poisonous injection into him *on Christmas eve*. Her father was a doctor who didn't support the nazi party and happened to have a heart murmur. The doctor used a checkup as an opportunity to murder my great grandfather. I think my Oma was 10 at the time. 

She saw and lived through horror and food insecurity that most people can't comprehend. Yet, still, she managed to come out the other side without that horror darkening her outlook and capacity for love. Instead I think it made her even more focused on bringing light and hope into her life and her family's lives.

My Oma had this thing for picking up pennies. Didn't matter what side it was on, all pennies were lucky. She'd say the same thing whenever she'd pick up a penny, ""finding a penny is always lucky, someone's looking out for you because it's one penny that you didn't have before"". 

My Oma was diagnosed with breast cancer when back in the 90s when cancer therapies were definitely not as good as they are now. She went through a remission before the cancer came back and she sadly died. It was devestating on everyone in the family. She was such a loving family matriarch...and was such an inspiration of having a huge capacity for hope and love in the face of sadness & darkness.

From then on, an interesting thing happens to people in the family.... Whenever someone is going through a very tough time in their life, they start to find pennies everywhere. Like a noticeable amount. If you think about it, you could go weeks without finding a penny on the ground. But when any of us would be consumed with sadness/hopelessness/suicidal thoughts like ""this is too much I don't think I can go on"", we'd start finding pennies on the ground every day. Even multiple pennies a day. And even more interesting, the pennies would most often be really shiny. And then when someone starts to feel better and regain confidence/hope/strength....the instance of finding pennies would start to decrease and go away. 

This has happened to everyone in our immediate family, even multiple times for people. I'm not religious at all, but this really defies explanation...and now I just go with it you know? Like myself and the family see this penny phenomena as a sign from Oma that things will get better. And for every penny we find... it's a physical reminder that she's there with us....supporting us and imbibing us with her own perseverance, hope, and love.

And what's cute is that when the pennies start coming in, we keep a little pile of them...and people in the family have these little mason jars of ""Oma pennies"" to represent tough times in their lives that they got through. It's quite literally a physical sign, just like your feather, from the universe-loved one to just let you know that *everything is going to be okay*."	19	1589996182.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gn62cf/if_youve_ever_asked_the_universe_for_some_kind_of/fr9ed5u/	0

My wife, on the other hand, has only ever played once. At the time neither of us had ever played, so we decided to just do the scratch off things. I just picked two at random, and when they rang them up it was $40! It hadn’t even occurred to me that different scratch offs might cost different amounts, and I had picked two of the most expensive ones they had. I figured what the hell and just paid for them. When we got home we scratched ‘em off and I of course won squat, but she won $50, so she never played again. She figured she’s $30 in the black, so there was no reason to throw it away trying to win any more.	13	1589977297.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gn62cf/if_youve_ever_asked_the_universe_for_some_kind_of/fr8f6zb/	0

On the way home from my nephew's funeral I had to drive 7 hours. I sobbed the whole way, even stopping to pull over in some random fields to scream and kick rocks because I was so upset.

It was about 10 at night and I was driving in the middle of nowhere and my aux cord stopped working. I resigned myself to listening to the radio but all the channels couldn't receive a signal. I was frustrated and kept flipping through them trying to find something that wasn't static. All of a sudden a blurb of a song came through. It was Fred Astaire's ""Cheek to Cheek"" and the only words that came through were ""Heaven. I'm in Heaven."" Then it was straight static. I got chills through my whole body and tried to flip channels again. It was straight static again until I hit a channel where some random station announcer said something like ""And that was a song by \*my nephew's first name\*"" and then it cut out to static again before the last name of the artist.

I was so overwhelmed that I had to pull over at a gas station and cry in my car some more. It was one of the eeriest and most reassuring things that has ever happened to me."	35	1589981592.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gn62cf/if_youve_ever_asked_the_universe_for_some_kind_of/fr8lmpw/	0

This happened last night. 
 
Late night dinner emergency left the wife and I needing to get food.  Everything was closing soon but if I hurried, I could make it to TB in time. 
 
As I pull up I start feeling bad about ordering so close to closing but I've already promised the wife TB, too late to back out now.  
 
Start my order and the person on the speaker cuts me off and informs me that the credit card reader is down and 5hey only are taking cash (I'm thinking this was a lie because it was so close to closing, but I'm okay with it). 
 
Since I have no cash, I apologize and leave.  
 
Right next door is a McDonald's with a couple cars in line.  Fuck it, good enough. 
 
I get in line, place my order and pull up behind the car currently at the window. 
 
It was about now that I realize I dont have my wallet at all.  It's still sitting on the kitchen counter. 
 
I contemplate just getting the hell out of there but as I start to put it in reverse the car at the window pulls ahead.  At this point I decided I should just tell them to cancel the order or eat it themselves since I couldn't pay. 
 
I pull up, look at the lady behind the window and before I can say anything she says, ""You're good, the car ahead of you paid for your meal."" 
 
I was FLOORED. 
 
I didnt ask for a sign, and not sure what this was telling me, but it sure felt important."	23	1589979892.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gn62cf/if_youve_ever_asked_the_universe_for_some_kind_of/fr8ix9u/	0

On a Wednesday evening, I said to my husband we should consider getting a second cat as a playmate for ours. He agreed that we should discuss it (getting him to agree to have the discussion is half the battle).

On Saturday morning, I get a picture from my mum of an adorable but terrified six week old little black kitten. 'Cute, I want!' I messaged her half joking. The kitten had been dumped in the woods,and my parents found her when they were walking the dog. They then took her to the rescue shelter, who warned that if she wasn't adopted that day she'd die (rescues in my parents' country are not in a good state).

Cue a frenzied amount of phone calls on a Saturday afternoon(we were two weeks out from a vacation we couldn't cancel) including having the vet give her shots so she could go in the cattery we had booked for our eldest, and the next day we drove 2.5 hours to another country to pick her up.

She has been with us for over 5 years now and is the sweetest thing you can imagine. She loves her big adoptive sister, and was best friends with my parents' dog until he passed away last autumn.

Turns out we didn't need that discussion of a second kitty after all!"	13	1589998638.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gn62cf/if_youve_ever_asked_the_universe_for_some_kind_of/fr9jgs1/	0

I wish I had had a program like this, it could have prevented years of sexual abuse in my life. I’m so glad you found the courage to speak up!

Your last line resonated with me because that’s very similar to what I say about the sexual assault support centre that provided me with trauma and group counselling as an adult.

Not even five minutes later, all of the Christmas lights that I had strung up around my room started blinking.

I decided to end it all one night. Got in a cab and asked the driver to take me to a bridge. (There are a lot of big bridges in Seoul). He saw me crying in the backseat and asked me why I wanted to go to the bridge. I told him that I wanted to jump off of it and then he pulled the car over to the side of the road and then asked if he could pray for me. I started to sob as he prayed. At the end, he took me home free of charge. Before I got off, he asked for my number so that he could check up on me. This was five years ago and he still sends me prayers to this day.	3395	1589971196.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gn62cf/if_youve_ever_asked_the_universe_for_some_kind_of/fr8884v/	2

Once I did that, an insane amount of relief washed over me. I knew this wasn't normal and called my primary the next day.

I am not a religious person at all. But my mother was very sick in the hospital. Her birthday was the next day, and I was planning on seeing her that day for a visit in the hospital. I decided to pray, that she made it to her birthday just so I can see her and that she could have one last birthday. I went to see her. Sadly she wasn't awake from all the medication, but I spoke to her for a while and she grabbed and held my hand in her somewhat asleep state.


She passed away around 1AM, an hour after her birthday had ended."	119	1589967198.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gn62cf/if_youve_ever_asked_the_universe_for_some_kind_of/fr848sj/	0

Exactly the same but also completely different. And nobody even notices how much it's changed. Except you.

I gave a guy a ride in the city once. It was after midnight. He had me drop him off in an rural area I didn't know, so he ends up directing me to a closed down grocery store in the middle of nowhere. No houses anywhere within site this place. I pulled into a gas station directly in front of the grocery store. The gas station was closed but I knew they had cameras rolling all the time, and it was lit like daytime. He was insisting that I drop him off behind it. Even tried to bribe me with some CDs and crap he had, said we could hang out for a bit. 

Now look maybe this guy just lonely and wanted company. Maybe he didn't want to walk from the gas station. Maybe he wanted to do something crazy. I don't know but the environment had me very uneasy and I followed my gut on that one. The more insistent he got about me driving around the back of the grocery store, the more insistent I became that I wasn't going to and the ride was over right here. And nothing really came of it. He hopped out and thanked me for the ride. Scared the hell out of me."	1073	1589966455.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gn62cf/if_youve_ever_asked_the_universe_for_some_kind_of/fr83j4m/	3

They're all so kind because they don't demand underpaying for art. Often I get offered more because they believe I am underselling. They're all good people.

EDIT: I've got a lot of responses to this which isn't surprising lol. It's kind of a weird thing, you know? But here's some information about what I do:

I mostly draw reference sheets, posed characters, icons, badges, things like that. I very rarely get requests for porn, I believe most of the furry community isn't interested in porn, and especially not fetish porn, but those are the things you see at the surface because they're so outlandish.

I make about $50-$100 for a commission. I'm actually not very popular at all in the community. I have no traditional schooling (past highschool art classes), all of my art is self taught so I'm not great at shading and lighting, but some people are into my drawings so I'm happy with that! A lot of the appeal of creating furry art comes from the fact that the characters are so creative and colorful and very fun to draw, and they mean so much to their owners and it makes creating art very satisfying.

I myself don't identify as a furry, but I have a fursona I made based off the animals I like and the colors I like. The thing is I don't really ""identify"" with her, which is why I don't consider myself a furry, but everyone's identity is different.

One night I was walking out to eat some supper on my own when a little old Chinese lady came up to me and told me I was beautiful, elegant, special, and that I was with the wrong person, I should hold out because I belonged with a better man, someone who would treat me properly. She was so sweet and apologised for being so abrupt as to approach me. She also wasn't trying to set me up with her son etc. or sell me anything! She really made my evening.

She started swigging it like water! I asked her to pull over and when she drove off called the cops and gave them her ln.

The other on the flip side was when four burly ass dudes picked me up and were speaking a very different accent, I hopped in wondering if these were to be my last days and they took me to the train station I was heading to and waited there with me until my train came.

Those close encounters still haunt me now because I think about how much worse it could've been.

Most drivers were really good and kind people. Just not all of them.

And most hitchhikers are also good and kind people who just need help getting somewhere. But yeah, not all of them either.

If you’ve ever asked the universe for some kind of sign and got it clear as day, what was it and how did it go?		t5_2qh1i	"I was close once. I had locked myself in my boyfriend's bathroom and was taking the lid off a family sized bottle of tylenol. Nobody knew the entirety of my world caving in for the last few months leading up to this moment. I just felt very, very alone and didn't have a home to go to. I just wanted it to be over.

I took the lid off and was holding a handful of what I later learned is a miserable way to go.

At that moment, my boyfriend knocked on the bathroom door and said that our friend had killed himself.

I saw my friend earlier that day. He just seemed a little moody, like he was tired. He was someone that could make you laugh in a millisecond just passing him in the hall. Smart as all hell. Had the world on a string and such a bright future ahead of him. Nobody saw that plot twist coming. You can never truly get into someone else's head. 

It's crazy how one minute changed so many lives. 

I can't say I've done anything that marvelous with my existence, and fuck, can life be hard. But there are small moments every single day that bring me joy. Most of them involve my cats, but alas.

I was almost at my street when I noticed a car behind me, it wasn’t close to me, I don’t believe it was behind me for long and there was nothing outwardly different about it to any other car that had been behind me that entire drive.. but for some reason my instincts told me something was off, that they had bad intentions. 

I turned into my street where my house was, you could see it from the main road easily as it was only about 10 houses into it. I decided to look in my rear view mirror and watched as the car stopped in the middle of the main road and just looked down my street.. watching me drive.  I would have been home alone that night.

If you’ve ever asked the universe for some kind of sign and got it clear as day, what was it and how did it go?		t5_2qh1i	"That gut feeling is really interesting, I think it's a form of consciousness a lot of animals share but as humans we've ignored it thinking that the black & white brain we're used to is superior (it's really not,  as a society we're slowly learning that). 

I don't know the perfect comparison but I like the idea that our conscious mind can process about 7 items of information at a time (very rough idea, but based on the idea that we can hold 7 seperate forms of info in our short term memory, it's the number of seperate numbers or names that the average person can remember at one time). That's 7 pieces of info we can relate to and rearrange to make meaning. The mind that does not form conscious words has no such constraints. It can link a wide diverse amount of info that you're not even aware of. But it has no words to share those links with your conscious mind. It can only really 'communicate' through feelings and visions as in dreams (interestingly Nikola Tesla would get visions showing him what would turn out into his best ideas/inventors, it wasn't magic, just a way to access a higher calculator than the one he was typically using). That's why visualization exercises can be so powerful, it's a way to communicate with your unconscious what you want in your life and it 'magically' uses it's links to make it happen. And for me, if I have a dream that seems very meaningful, not just in the content but also in the feeling it's left with me, it can really help clear up some things or build better understanding of something that happened or something I need to do. Sitting with a feeling too, brings me an insight that I've been forgetting about, something I've been avoiding doing or whatever, and almost energises the action itself when the emotion is held in awareness rather than ran away from.

But yeah back to the topic lol I think it's amazing what that sixth sense can do. And even if it's not perfectly reading a situation, it can definitely tell when things aren't adding up."	23	1589979773.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gn62cf/if_youve_ever_asked_the_universe_for_some_kind_of/fr8iqpk/	1

I enjoy your take on the topic. If you enjoy reading, you should check out The Gift of Fear by Gavin De Becker. It’s very cool to see his research on the subject. 

I think sometimes the universe is trying really hard to tell you something and it’ll use any way to make you listen. I’ve had dreams like those, too, where I wake up and know what I definitely have to do. I was dating a man once who was on paper everything I’d want in a guy, and I was very confused as to why something didn’t feel right, so I ignored my feelings because I couldn’t imagine this was someone I had to let go of. After two months of this I started having these reoccurring nightmares that I was running away from a tall man who would find me anywhere. I could not hide or escape no matter what I did. After the second time dreaming this, I knew I had to break up with him. I put it off for another week and had the dream two more times. After that last time, I did it that day and I have never had that dream again. I now know I dodged a bullet since that man ended up having severe anger issues I had not yet seen since the relationship was so new.

In maryland you can cash in losers for extra points and they would do this. But it got to the point where the losers they collected well you could only put in like 500 points a day or like 50 losers a day. I started doing it because my sports team offered a chance at season tickets for 20 years. I entered and entered and entered.  After getting these guys losers about 1 in every 100th ticket was a small winner missed by the players 

After 3 months I won season tickets for one season and 250 bucks to spend at the game after never having spent more than say 25 bucks on lotto tickets in the whole  3 months. Totally worth it. Also maryland didnt tell me I had won no announcements  no email.

It's cool but ultimately a finished piece can take me anywhere from 6 hours to 3 days and that's a pretty significant time investment when I work full-time now, and doodles are just that - doodles.

People of Reddit, what are some cool, but completely useless talents you can do?		t5_2qh1i	"Ooh! I have a couple of these:

1. I can divide almost any number by 2, 3, or 4 in a very short time with a great deal of accuracy. When I was a waiter, for the year or so after the credit card machines went mobile, it was commonplace to bring the cheque (and the machine) and THEN find out how they wanted to handle the bill. So I got really good at grabbing three or four cards in hand and doing the math right there in real time.
2. I can flip almost any oblong object really fast and catch it after X revolutions. So I can flip, say, a knife, really really fast and then grab it by the handle. I can't juggle (I've tried), but if I COULD juggle, I could very easily juggle knives or flaming torches.
3. I know a lot about tarantulas. A lot. An obscene amount. More than is healthy, probably. Related, I'm really good at buying and selling tarantulas at just enough profit to fund my tarantula-raising habit.
4. I am really, really good at making up songs on the spot, that scan and rhyme and mostly make sense and are often at least a little clever. In another life I would have been a killer marketing jingle guy or an awesome rapper. This is not a completely useless talent, as this random habit is very entertaining and me and my son and wife spend a lot of time singing very silly songs (and then critiquing how good the song was, and then maybe singing a song about how much the song sucked), but it's not something I can put on a resume.
5. I have a very in-depth command of Post-War Japanese cinema. Which, really, no one could possibly care less about. Maybe you can get someone to watch *Seven Samurai* if you're lucky, but that's about it.
6. I know all the French verbs than use Etre in the Passe-Compose (instead of Avoir).
7. I have several Shakespearean monologues, and a couple of poems, memorized. Just in case.

Man, that seems like too many now that I write them out."	9	1589990229.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gnb7ty/people_of_reddit_what_are_some_cool_but/fr91umk/	0

People of Reddit, what are some cool, but completely useless talents you can do?		t5_2qh1i	"I'm hypermobile (double-jointed if you prefer) in all of my fingers and my elbows.

I can, with palms down, touch my elbows and wrists together the same time, and do this thing where I twist my elbow and shoulder inwards but not my wrist, which makes my forearm sit really oddly.

Can't do much with my fingers anymore, but until I was around 13, I could press my right index finger all the way back to touch the back of that hand. That one really freaked people out, and other kids at school would stop me in the hallways all the time just to ask to see it. I had to stop showing people after I switched schools cuz it got annoying, and not doing it for years is probably why I can't anymore."	3	1589990616.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gnb7ty/people_of_reddit_what_are_some_cool_but/fr92n6j/	0

People of Reddit, what are some cool, but completely useless talents you can do?		t5_2qh1i	"Hey, I’m someone who knows all of the countries, as well as a pretty large amount about each. Quizzes are definitely the way to go, specifically map quizzes, as that can help you connect a shape to a name. Vexillology quizzes will also help with this, plus it’s just useful to know which flag you’re looking at.

I’d also check out Geography Now. Pretty cool YouTube channel that goes into an in-depth explanation of all countries alphabetical (current they’re on São Tomé and Principe) and is a useful tool if you want to learn the culture and actual things about the countries. 

I’d also recommend breaking them up into regions, and I don’t mean continents. For example, break the Asian Countries up into Southeast Asia, the Caucus Region, the Arabian Peninsula, Central Asia (The Stans), etc, and break Europe up into Western Europe, Scandinavia, the Balkans, The Baltic Nations, etc. This will help you remember the countries quicker, since you’ll only have to memorize at most 5-15 for each region instead of 30-50."	4	1589995689.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gnb7ty/people_of_reddit_what_are_some_cool_but/fr9dbaa/	0

People of Reddit, what are some cool, but completely useless talents you can do?		t5_2qh1i	"Here are a couple tips I've found really help:

* Many words can often be rearranged to spell other words with the same letters. For example, if you see ""eat,"" it's very likely you can also make ""ate,"" ""tea,"" and ""eta."" 

* Looking for suffixes that can tag onto existing words, like ""-ed,"" ""-ic,"" or ""-ing."" If you're feeling particularly saucy, stuff like ""-ish,"" ""-tion,"" or ""-ally"" also works.

* Prefixes are also good. ""Pro-,"" ""anti-,"" ""re-,"" ""en-,"" and others have served me well.

* This one works especially well if you're playing on a mobile device: just try stuff. They'll tell you whether or not your word is a word. I generally go for smaller words because if I'm wrong I didn't waste a lot of time.

**Procreation**

For some reason this was the number 1 priority from our feedback groups by a wide margin. We expected your multiplication rate to be higher given the overuse of this feature...

* Made pregnancy a more controllable process. Some people were having trouble procreating whereas many more were unintendedly starting the process (prematurely). While many factors still come into play (age, sex, lifestyle and genetic fertility mainly), the luck factor has been significantly decreased. Sorry for all you folks who maxed out the luck attribute...
* Increased size of the female clitoris. It was always meant to be a fun puzzle for the partner, but apparently even some females were having trouble finding their own and that obviously was never intended;
* Every male receives a 10% increase in penis length and girth. The thing was functioning perfectly fine and completely as intended yet the males kept complaining and feeling insufficient so there. We listened. Now stop complaining!
* Lowered the standard deviation on penile length. There were always meant to be some variance but apparently it was too high, making the men near the mean (the vast majority) way too insecure;
* Lowered the standard deviation on breast size. Same reason as above but now applying to females;
* Replaced the turkey neck skin on men's ballsack with human skin. To be honest, this was just an oversight from our development crunch. Was always meant to be proper skin. Sorry!
* Moved the male prostate to just below the perineum for ease of access. Interestingly, this was mainly requested by straight men;
* Gave humans of both sexes more control over their anus. We never intended the waste disposal system to be used in this fashion but since you people kept doing it...
* The testicles, vagina and penis have increased durability and less pain receptors. We figured we had done enough to protect these areas but you people ~~are fucking stupid~~ inventive;
* Have decreased transmission and morbidity rates for all veneral diseases. You're welcome;
* Have introduced a new veneral disease called 'exploding genital syndrome'. It's triggered when attempting to engage in sexual intercourse with other species and humans that have not yet developed secondary sex characteristics. Take a hint you fucking pervs, you know who you are!


**Intelligence and psyche**

* Have decreased the aggression tendency because sweet Jesus, what the fuck?
* Have increased historical memory and learning ability. You're supposed to learn from previous mistakes, not repeat them (evolution and all that);
* Fixed a bug where a lot of people had broken morality code. There will always be a few without just to keep things interesting, but the percentage of people who had it disabled was way too high. Morality code will still be based on culture, upbringing, nurture, etc.;
* Have significantly lowered the amount of people with mental diseases. The percentages were way off!
* The intelligence distribution system was way out of whack! It was supposed to be a standard deviation type of graph, not a negative non-linear relationship!


**Other**

* Have made the weight gain/loss system more predictable. The system still functions more or less the same, it's just that we've given everyone the same genetics so you no longer have to guess which system will work for you;
* All humans now genetically know how to swim. How did you guys not have this? We implemented this for just about every other species! Couldn't you fuckers have picked it up somewhere along the line? 
* Decreased sugar cravings for all humans. It's a solid system from an evolutionary point of view but since you guys have learned to grow food all year around, the high sugar cravings were no longer necessary;"	43	1589986642.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gn9a4q/if_we_are_all_living_in_the_human_body_version_10/fr8uplu/	2

- Parameters FAT_GAIN and FAT_LOSS have been readjusted to better suit current user habits.

- New feature: Poop shutoff. Originally, the bowel system was designed to maximize waste disposal automatically, with limited user control.

Coz version 1.0’s process is loooong & hideous; it hurts like a knife-wielding biatch; it rips your minge so bad that your pooper and fanny become one; and then you’re left with this helpless creature that needs constant attention BUT you’re already tired as fuck. Then to top it off, you’re left with a permanent wizard sleeve & a leaky snatch. Bonza.	41	1589974766.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gn9a4q/if_we_are_all_living_in_the_human_body_version_10/fr8c1jp/	3

this patch is considered **critical** and should be applied as soon as possible. This patch contains security, performance and breakfix changes.  Humans left unpatched may display unintended behavior, including security risks and exploitable vulnerabilities.

**Security updates**    

*Fixed bug in trust model where excessive positive attention could overflow buffer and allow attackers to bypass expected logic checks (the so-called ""love bombing"" attack)

*Perception filters should no longer excessively weight familiarity, and assign inappropriately high threat values to unfamiliar events.

*repeatedly asserting an obviously incorrect statement will no longer overflow incredulity buffer and cause values to be taken as ""True"" when, in fact, they remain obviously false.



**general performance**

*fixed memory leak where important, infrequently accessed information would be overwritten by useless trivia.
*removed overzealous garbage collector which caused current objective to be purged from memory when walking into another room.

*multiple back-end fixes in extreme heights module should prevent unit from experiencing sudden suicidal or homicidal thoughts.

*improved performance of auditory buffer, random segments of music and/or musical lyrics should no longer execute repeatedly at arbitrary times.


**bug fixes**

If we are all living in the human body version 1.0, what sort of updates would be expected for version 1.1?		t5_2qh1i	"Human Body 1.1 patch notes:


Orthopedic: 

- Vastly increased vascularization of all connective tissues, allowing proper tissue regeneration. Many injuries previously requiring surgical intervention can now heal on their own given time and rest. 

- Reinforced exterior of vertebral discs to mitigate  risk of herniation.


Neuro / Psych:

- Nerve tissue now has increased elasticity and tensile strength to decrease likelihood of damage and disability.

- Increased efficiency of sleep. Less is needed to function at current levels, or players can still sleep a full 8 hours to receive powerful “well rested” buffs lasting up to 12 hours. 

- Mental health “check engine” light added in bottom left corner of field of view. This light does not diagnose specific disorders, only alert the player.



Metabolism:

- In an effort to battle CVD, Obesity, and diabetes, players who maintain a positive energy balance (net weight gain) for too long will receive the following debuffs: Decreased appetite 10%, Aversion to sweet food 50%, and fat cell thermogenesis 0.5% volume/day. These issues are ongoing and will require future balancing.


Digestive:

- Green coloring added to farts."	2	1589990811.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gn9a4q/if_we_are_all_living_in_the_human_body_version_10/fr931fh/	0

The HUMAN rebalance!

Mother Earth has been complaining that the vermin are eating her dry. This update throws a few hurdles into the gene pool as well as extending overall server life. We hope.

- Dietary intolerance: Some food groups will be locked for some individuals. This need may or may not be hereditary - we left that up to the dev(s).

- The Heavy Update: Exercise changes now have wider variable impact on BMI. 

- Mood Indigo: Large scale storms now occur more often.

- Gene Rockin-berry: Genetic diversity and malfunction frequency is buffed

- F*** Greenland: Pandemics have an increased chance to occur.

- The Magic Greenhouse: CO2 balance updates carry over from the last patch. They get a small buff too, if the word ""exponential"" is anything to go by.

- Day Breaks: Solar activity is nerfed.

- XX marks the spot: Secondary Y chromosome is still being slowly nerfed. Exciting news is in store for the Attack of the Clones update!

- 2020 event hotfix: Population control events are slated for 2020. Perfectly envisioned, as it should be."	2	1589997776.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gn9a4q/if_we_are_all_living_in_the_human_body_version_10/fr9hoes/	0
If we are all living in the human body version 1.0, what sort of updates would be expected for version 1.1?		t5_2qh1i	"**Patch notes: Human bodies (Homo Spaiens) 1.1.45435**

We would like to thank you for your continued patience and appreciate the coorporation. This bustling community continues to showcase why, even with additional difficulties that you will always raise to the top.

User notes: **Physical**

- Fixed glitch where user can swallow their own tongue on ocassion. Tongue is now slightly more firmly routed in the back of the mouth.

- Fixed error where swallowing saliva can lead to temporary choking.

- Improved gradual scaling response for immune system against non-threatening ingestion of unusual, yet edible foods, such as peanuts. We will monitor this carefully to ensure other immuno-response files are not impacted by this.

- Eyelashes no longer get lodged in eyes. We have introduced a very minor (~3mm) ejection speed for damaged/destroyed eyelashes and an optional shut eye reflex that kicks in outside of work or driving modes. 

- Slightly increased nominal lung capacity. We want to test this gradually to ensure we are not overtaxing the tissue.

- Reduced period cramps/pains. We wish to apologise for this one, it is still unclear why the first build was so badly optimised. Dave has been reprimanded for this. Fucking *Dave.*

User notes: **Mental updates**

- Fixed glitch where user can randomly bite into mouth/tongue. We apprethiate your patience, as thith one was a tough cookie to crack. 

- Added an extra set of teeth that will be added to the mouth at roughly age 35-40 (optional, user will be prompted every 12 months during this time period.).

- Updated common_sense, rational_thinking and general_respect files in the brain and redistributed among all of humanity.

- Added hotfix to dreams file in the brain, these should now be added to memory and can be forgotten or remembered by choice.

- Added extra measures to prevent mental illnesses. We know this is the most requested feature by far, so please bear with us as we want to take small steps to ensure that we don't further create any sociopath worms in humanity.

Again, I wish to take time to thank you all again for your understanding. Our next update will include a preliminary step towards auto-controlling and remembering lucid dreaming, improved subconcious processing, and additional fixes for various mental and physical health issues! Until then, I wish you all a great day and may your adventures benefit from the above features!

Non Americans of reddit. What is the Alabama of your country?		t5_2qh1i	"I live in the Netherlands so I'll translate this to city level because we only have 17 million people in our country. 

The city closest to Alabama would be Dordrecht.

The government gave Dupont permission to build a chemical plant there so you know the worth our govt places on the people living there. 

And the general Dutch opinion of this town is pretty much summed up by the nation wide saying about this town:

""Hoe dichter bij Dordt, hoe rotter het word."" this translates to: 'the closer to dordrecht you've trodden, more things became rotten."" (works better as a rhyme in my language)

When we moved there the priest from the church across the road came to visit to see if we were living in sin or not.

I asked him if he was the leader of the Congolese congregation that always showed up dressed to the nines in outlandishly flamboyant styles. 

He replied: ""The blackies? O nonono. They just use my building sometimes.""

When we went to bars to find some new friends and struck up conversation most people would remark: ""you're not from around here are you?"" followed by stone walling. At first I thought it was a defense mechanism against the busloads of tourists that came to the city every day(the old kingdoms became a united country in this city and government held office there) So I started convo's by saying we just moved into a house in the centre and if people had some tips etc. And still they said the same until an old ladt pulled me aside and just flat out told me that these people would never accept outsiders and she'd been facing exclusion for 12 years. 

Also, maaany fights outside my house. Random people screaming in the streets. Rampant rascism by store personell. Never seen people behave so badly in my life. 

My car got keyed 7 times. Nails in my tires. Car got broken into. The landlord was a complete bitch that wanted us to pay part of the roof repairs after a storm. I went to the doctor to see about a growth I had and he described a salve, back in my home town the doctor took one look turned and said it's the type of cancer that the dupont chemicals cause. 

There were shootings every week, police helicopter circling was a daily thing and one street was permanently cordonned off by the police because it was too dangerous there. (all very, very unique in my country where police officers reach the national news when they pull their weapon without discharging) 

I lived there only 11 months and hated every single second of it. This hatred runs so deep that I gladly pay extra to buy the same product from an online vendor that's not based in that city."	11	1590012860.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gni3po/non_americans_of_reddit_what_is_the_alabama_of/fra7xo9/	2

Non Americans of reddit. What is the Alabama of your country?		t5_2qh1i	"Brabant, a province in the Netherlands. Let me explain. Everyone in the Netherlands just chills out all year. Not these guys.

They have a thing called carnaval, which for some reason is in the winter (fun fact, the Dutch coronavirus patient zero attended carnaval, all of Brabant was fucked). This is a full week of dressing up, parades, partying and alcohol. Leading up to carnaval of course there are pre-parties to gear up and strengthen the liver.

It is normal to start drinking when you're 13 or so in Brabant. The adults are celebrating carnaval and getting hammered, let the kids chill out with their friends!

They talk in a distinctly different accent, they have a soft g (while up north I sound like I'm choking on phlegm when I pronounce a g). 

They love their farmers. The farmers took their tractors to The Hague and ran down the front door of a government building, ran down a fence nearly killing a cyclist and causing major traffic. I don't know if those people were from Brabant but I'm lumping them in. 

Brabant is the place to be to make drugs. If you're taking xtc in Europe chances are it was produced in Brabant. Barrels of chemical waist are regularly dumped in fields. I read they are making the switch to crystal meth.

I'm sure other people can think of a lot more whacky Brabant things, I'd love to hear them."	5	1590010802.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gni3po/non_americans_of_reddit_what_is_the_alabama_of/fra5soj/	3

Non Americans of reddit. What is the Alabama of your country?		t5_2qh1i	"Upon reflection I think Brabant is more like Florida, Friesland is like Alabama.
In Friesland people are way too proud of their province. Patriotism is not really a thing here, except in Friesland. But they just love Friesland. If they could, they would split off and float out in the north sea. They have a distinct flag for the province that they love waving around- nobody else does it. 

Friesland is populated mostly by farmers and cows, I'm led to believe that all my milk comes from there. During new years day they fill big metal milk jugs with some explosive compound and put a ball on top of it. Then they light it and the ball goes flying off into the farmland, it's called karbietschieten.

Sometime at the start of a new year they collect old Christmas trees and nowadays any tree they can find. These are made into a mountain (honestly they are huge, the highest point you will find in our flat land) and light them on fire! They have a competition to see who can make the biggest one, measured in volume. I think this is called vreugdevuur.

Finally there is a jest going on between Friesland and the rest of the Netherlands. They see us as 'city people' and we see them as 'bunch of farmers'. This has really gotten out of hand lately, people are pretty salty both ways. It has led to some good memes though."	2	1590011710.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gni3po/non_americans_of_reddit_what_is_the_alabama_of/fra6q3a/	2

Our population went from 300k in 1970 to 1.1M now so most people are from somewhere else; foreign or other parts of Canada. People love to post pictures of Banff then proceed to shit on us.

BOER-EEEEEEN!

And on hearing this I had to think that, as an Aberdonian, I had a similar experience. Except, in my country the insult wasn't quite so soft as 'farmer'. We were forced to take the concept of shagging sheep, and make it our identity.

I'm an American who grew up in Paris, and while I've never experienced outright rudeness to me or visiting English-speakers, I have seen them switch to English if someone's French isn't perfect.

Even in France, Parisians have a reputation for snobbishness (I love 'em anyways), so I recommend a trip to the south or the countryside if you go back. It's the same with NYC here. I was talking to a guy from Brooklyn abroad and I mentioned that I lived there for a summer. He got angry and said that I had no real knowledge of what Brooklyn was since I wasn't born there. People can be very protective of their culture.

As for Canadian French, it does sound quite strange for those used to continental French, to the point where I have difficulty communicating when I go there. Here is a comedy sketch that gives you an idea of what French people find funny (but will probably mean nothing to non-native speakers): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMdFnFjyR48

But people should never go beyond some good-natured ribbing when it comes to these things.

Thinking nuclear war had already broken out, the submarine commanders thought the charges being dropped were intended to sink the sub, and firing on them would be defensive.

What single event in history do you think changed the world the most?		t5_2qh1i	During thr Cuban missile crisis a Soviet submarine found itself surrounded by American destroyers and dove to avoid being detected, they lost contact with Moscow due to the dive and did not hear anything for a number of days. An American ship started to drop some practice depth charges which the sub believed were real depth charges. Two of the three senior officers believed that war must have started and decided to launch a nuclear tipped torpedo. Luckily unanimous agreement between the three senior officers is needed, and the third refused to agree, realising that they may have not been actual depth charges, he calmed the captain and convinced him to surface to reestablish contact. If it was launched it was very likely that it would have resulted in a global thermonuclear war. If not for this third man it would be a very different world we live in today.	15	1589984090.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gnb7gp/what_single_event_in_history_do_you_think_changed/fr8pyh4/	0

Though he himself might not of had a solid grasp on its teachings, he converted to Christianity on his death bed and throughout his emperorship was pro Christian in a time where that was not popular. His acceptance of Christianity definitely shifted the public opinion on Christianity. Honestly not sure how the world would be different without him, but there’s a chance Christianity wouldn’t have become the largely followed religion and like every war after that would probably be different?

What single event in history do you think changed the world the most?		t5_2qh1i	"Goddamn is there a list here.

Splitting of the HRE by the grandsons of Charlamagne. There were 3 kingdoms created, and if you look up the borders of lotharingia you will see what a fucking garbage mess it was. Formed the basis of franco-germanic rivalries for the next millennia. The borders of lotharingia beyond the alps was contested between the new HRE and france because there was never any clear owner, and the ages and ages of bad blood from arguing started right there, when the land went to a 3rd party in the most undefendable borders possible.

The 4th crusade's detour. The 4th crusade was hot garbage, detouring to constantinople to help a deposed emperor get back the byzantine emperor through a venician middle man to the crusaders. Turns out the emperor who deposed him left the royal coffers dry so the city was fucking decimated by pillaging crusaders.

To go down how consequential this was. Constantinople was the lynchpin of the byzantines. Losing it gave the ottomans the leverage to ""help"" the byz get their land back (which the ottomans obviously didnt give back after ""helping"" them). This meant the ottomans could take over the balkans and turkey, becoming the super power they did. THIS then forced europe to look for new chinese trade routes to keep from paying trade tax to a muslim nation. This caused a push for an eastern route search which gave rise to deep water traversal technology which caused european colonialism.

TLDR; that- the 4th crusade in the 1200s caused european colonialism to happen early, possibly at all (though that is less concrete).

The adoption of roman christianity was done by a single battle. The emperor had a dream where god told him to paint the initials of jesus on his army's shields and if he did he'd win the next battle. He did, and he won. There was a lot more nuiance that I wont get into, but this was the tipping point that caused christianity to be formally adopted as the roman faith, which caused literally anything church related in europe.

The choice for khwarezmia to insult genghis khan. Insult is a light word, try murdering his diplomats and force GK's hand when he was trying to move past raiding (rading the middle east at least). This is around modern day persia, turkey, and the -stan countries. The mongols *fucking erased* Khwarezmia off the map and took over the land. This caused the mongols to push into modern day turkey which caused a gisnt power vacuum on the collapse of GK's ancestor's empires which then caused a scramble for power of which the Ottomans came out of... you get the picture on what the ottomans caused.

People mentiom technology like the printing press and such, but what caused europe to become this hotbed of new-age breadbaskets, colonialists, etc is so much more important. It's what lead to these creations in the first place, what caused their adoption, and what helped them spread as europe was the continent of nations.

Which lead to the rise of Napoleon and the Napoleonic Wars.

What single event in history do you think changed the world the most?		t5_2qh1i	"There are a couple ways of looking at this.

There are things that if they didn't happen the way they would have, would likely have come to be a different way. For example, if not Gutenberg, someone would have invented the printing press. If fire hadn't been discovered however it was discovered, it would have eventually been discovered another way. If the Code of Hammurabi wouldn't have been the first conceptualization of written law, something else would have been. If the Norse hadn't discovered North America, Columbus would have.

Then, there are things that almost certainly would not have happened if they hadn't happened the way they did. Examples would be the death of Ferdinand, the crucifixion of Jesus Christ (or, if you don't believe in it, the work of Paul to popularize of the story of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ), the unification of China (arguably), Genghis Kahn's empire, etc.

If we're talking about things of the first type, I'd say agriculture.

If we're talking about things of the second type, I'd say either Alexander the Great's Empire, which would not have happened without him, or what Paul did to plant the seeds of Christianity, which whether you consider it good, bad, true, false, whatever, it is without question that so many of the other examples provided here (WWI, WWII, the proliferation of printed communication, etc.) were either fueled by or built upon the lattice of Christianity or beliefs and institutions created in the service of it."	1	1589995922.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gnb7gp/what_single_event_in_history_do_you_think_changed/fr9dt7c/	0

The moment a human realised they could reliably plant and harvest crops, is the moment land became valuable and we stopped being nomadic. 

Land having value leads to land as property. Disputes over territory for its utility, beyond mere territorial instincts, is one of the causes (if not THE leading cause) of war throughout mankind's history.

Farming meant tribes/societies could support greater populations with the abundance that it facilitated. Populations way beyond the roughly 100 - 250 body ""chimposhere"" we evolved to deal with.

What single event in history do you think changed the world the most?		t5_2qh1i	The decision to use the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Had this not been done, the defeat of Japan in WW2 would have been through an amphibious invasion called operation downfall. It is estimated that this plan would have cost the lives of nearly a million American soldiers (with millions more wounded) and 5-10 million Japanese soldiers and civilians. In preparation for this attack, millions of purple heart awards (awards for death in the line of service) were made, and are still being given out to this day. After the bombings, the US became the first world superpower, and it is believed that other countries (specifically the USSR) had spies steal the findings of the Manhattan Project in order to build their own bombs. This lead to the Cold War between the US and the USSR, which defined the later half of the 20th century, which is responsible for numerous innovations in nuclear energy, medical and surveillance technology, pretty much everything involving space, and other modern technologies that served as the building blocks for those we use today. It also serves as the primary source of anti communist sentiment in the US today, and heavily influences social and economic policy to this day.	1	1590001000.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gnb7gp/what_single_event_in_history_do_you_think_changed/fr9oey3/	0

Most prominent of these was Kemal Ataturk who, after the war, became a senior voice in the Turkish nationalist movment after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire.

What single event in history do you think changed the world the most?		t5_2qh1i	"Everyone keeps saying things that were inevitable like Franz Ferdinand getting shot or the invention of the printing press but the world was going to go to war one way or another in 1914 and some time of printing press would have been invented at some point.

I am going to go with Rome not surrendering to Hannibal after the battle of Cannae. After getting their ass thoroughly kicked at Lake Tresimene and Trebia river, they took somewhere between 60,000-80,000 in losses including both consuls. With a completely devastated army, they elected to just fight all along the Italian peninsula but avoid Hannibal Barca and let him have his way wherever they went. The Second Punic War continued for SIXTEEN YEARS after Cannae but the strategy worked and eventually decisive victories in Iberia and Italy against generals who weren't Hannibal led to Scipio marching on Carthage. Hannibal was recalled to Africa and lost to Scipio at the Battle of Zama. The Romans beat the Carthaginians and would destroy Carthage five decades later.

If the Romans had surrendered after Cannae like every other civilization in the history of time would have done, the world would like completely different. There would have been no Roman Republic after the second century BC, no Julius Caesar, no Pax Romana, Jesus would have been born in a Parthian or Selucid providence, no Roman Empire, no Holy Roman Empire, no Byzantine Empire, and the list goes on and on.

Who knows what the world would look like if the Romans hadn't told Hannibal to kick rocks. One thing is for certain, it would have look a fuckton different than it does today."	22	1589992762.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gnb7gp/what_single_event_in_history_do_you_think_changed/fr972ze/	2

What single event in history do you think changed the world the most?		t5_2qh1i	"The debate about the ""turning point"" of WW2 is endless.  My opinion is the war was lost when [Hitler issued directive No. 33](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Adolf_Hitler%27s_directives), halting the drive to Moscow in favor of [eliminating the Soviet armies in Kiev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kiev_(1941)).  The loss of Kiev hurt the Soviets badly, but the Germans were ""on the clock"" and their failure to capture Moscow(the logistical hub of the USSR) before winter was the end for the Germans on the Eastern Front.  

> On 18 August, OKH submitted a strategic survey (Denkschrift) to Hitler regarding the continuation of operations in the East. The paper made the case for the drive to Moscow, arguing once again that Army Groups North and South were strong enough to accomplish their objectives without any assistance from Army Group Center. It pointed out that there was enough time left before winter to conduct only a single decisive operation against Moscow.  

> On 20 August, Hitler rejected the proposal based on the idea that the most important objective was to deprive the Soviets of their industrial areas.

Ive worked in movies and TV production, Only did a couple of Reality tv shows. We were filming at an airport when I decided never to work in the branch of entertainment again.

A huge network, which was seriously part of my childhood but has gone downhill since then, was filming a show where they paid artists to fly to LA and compete in something. We drove to the middle of PA and picked up this very niave, nice girl, and her best friend.

At the airport the directer and producer cornered her and said they didnt have any good footage and that she needed to start a fight with her best friend. The girl broke down in tears and did not do it. The whole time the directer and producer were beating down on her. Saying she had to do it, its what they paid her for.

What single event in history do you think changed the world the most?		t5_2qh1i	The plague definitely did reduce the workforce substantially, but it also showed the peasants that their kings weren't protected by a god. This realization opened the door for the latter half of the Renaissance and began the motions toward what we know as a state. But, it took until 1648 and the signing of the Treaty of Westphalia for our modern democracy to begin it's rapid ascension. Although I do believe the Black Plague was one of the most changing events in human history, I'm not sure how much I can subscribe to the idea that democracy wouldn't have formed. In my years of studying political science, I believe that people were always going to form some sort of democracy-esque society. The idea of democracy and republics date back to the Athenians and I'd like to believe it would've came about no matter what!	91	1589984269.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gnb7gp/what_single_event_in_history_do_you_think_changed/fr8q9zl/	2

What single event in history do you think changed the world the most?		t5_2qh1i	"Yes.  

World War 1 has to be understood in context.  The assassination of the Arch Duke was the excuse Germany had been looking for.  But that's all he was; an excuse.  And a substitute-able one at that.

Arch Duke Ferdinand wasn't that important of a figure during his life.  Any excuse would have done for Germany; a riot, a coup, some other blue blood getting shot, anything.  The Balkans was a powder keg during the early years of the 20th century and Germany was itching for an excuse to flex its newly industrialized muscle.

The assassination was the most immediate cause of the war but if Princip had forgotten to buy bullets for his gun, the war would have started in another week, another month, or another year.  His assassination is not THAT important because it could have been swapped out for a hundred other events that would have produced exactly the same outcome."	5	1589987524.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gnb7gp/what_single_event_in_history_do_you_think_changed/fr8wev9/	1

We don't actually know anything about that time period so its basically just theory but in the book he theorises that agriculture became a trap. People eventually started growing their own crops rather than just eating from wild growth - presumably because they felt it would be easier. Then they had to till the field, and have more children so they could mind the crop and cover the land theyve planted. Then the fact they've had children means they need to feed them which takes away the extra food to farm was meant to provide. Then you need to defend the crop from other people so you needs guards etc etc etc until eventually we became stationary and unhealthier.

At one point, the middle east had decent leaders and were rapidly becoming more modernized. They had buildings, instructure coming alone on par with others, people were treated decently. Women weren't forced to cover every inch of themselves. 

But, their stabilization meant they were gaining more and more power and say over what happened to the oil from their land and demanded to be properly compensated. So, naturally, it was decided the best approach would be to kill their leaders, bomb everything we could, and supply arms to the radicals. Then deny it all and paint hatred of western countries as just hate filled terrorism.

It only took nearly 70 years before the US would even admit to the Iranian coup in 1953.

It's not, though.  If you can take any given event and substitute it for something else and get the same outcome, then the event isn't that important.

If we substitute a riot in Zegreb for the assassination in Sarajevo we still get WW1 nearly exactly as it happened.  Contrast that with the events of 9/11.  If we swap out the planes flying into buildings with truck bombs or a mass shooting or attacks on embassies (by al-Qaeda) those won't lead to a war in Afghanistan or the Iraq war.

With the defense pacts from world war 1, it is like half the bar were wearing the gang colors for the Crips while the half were wearing Bloods.  Once shit kicked off, it didn't matter how or why it started.

What single event in history do you think changed the world the most?		t5_2qh1i	Thea and Earth shared the same orbit - an inherently unstable arrangement.

What single event in history do you think changed the world the most?		t5_2qh1i	Pulling from my really rusty physics memories but wouldnt Thea and Earth shared roughly the same mass and would have been going at around the same speed for them to have the same orbit? And how come earth survived but Thea didn’t?	1	1590002644.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gnb7gp/what_single_event_in_history_do_you_think_changed/fr9rt7a/	1

What single event in history do you think changed the world the most?		t5_2qh1i	Thea was at one of the Earth's solar Lagrange points, iirc.

How about this, then; let's ask some unbiased, third party experts in history.  We can work together to pose a question on /r/askhistorians to determine the importance of the ""pivotal-ness"" of this assassination on modern world history.  I am very willing to be wrong or flawed in my analysis.  But since you're not comfortable sharing a critique, let's have them do it."	1	1589992622.0	/r/AskReddit/comments/gnb7gp/what_single_event_in_history_do_you_think_changed/fr96sf4/	1
