Well, you can but people will just go somewhere else. You’re really changing the law under the guise of Covid-19? This makes no sense. People aren’t protected by tyranny. Please, please reconsider. It’d be a shame if Reddit goes down in history as yet another platform that bans “non-offensive” speech. Btw, the WHO is a joke. Do you think that they are magically spared from being a corrupted organization? You people are smart. So are we. Just tell the truth about it. It would be easier to swallow. I’m sure if you polled your users they would say that they would like all communication, from everybody, and they can use their own discernment and come to their own conclusions.

They aren't threatening people who want to talk about it not to talk about it on other subs: they simply are protecting the discussions of peoples who want to freely discuss other things but have a topic that doesn't fit too many other places.

The worry is that this sub will get flooded with CMVs about the pandemic  These posts will naturally be come popular and therefore slam down other users that want to have a meaningful talk about  why I believe religion and state should intertwined   or  why Disney is a worthwhile company  even with how they will do a lot of shady things in the name of profit   or even  why I think a Banana should be opened by the stem  CMV  

In order to protect the diversity of topics within this sub  this is a perfectly fine decision  They aren t threatening people who want to talk about it not to talk about it on other subs  they simply are protecting the discussions of peoples who want to freely discuss other things but have a topic that doesn t fit too many other places 

In other words  they are protecting freedom of speech more than they are hindering it  Weird to think about  huh

META: Temporary suspension of COVID-19/Coronavirus related posts (Effective March 27, 2020)		t5_2w2s8	"None of those rules forbid a topic, however that wasn't my point. My point was that there already are rules on this sub that stop people from saying whatever they want without risk of it being taken down.

As for ""protecting freedom of speech more than they are hindering it"", I wasn't kidding when I said it was a weird way to look at it. Maybe I can explain the logic a little bit in a better way:

Let me ask you, what is the point of freedom of speech if nobody can even hear you?

This little rhetorical question is to get you thinking along the lines that assuming everybody had **complete** freedom of speech, it would be like your voice being placed into a vacuum. So, are you still obtaining the benefits of the Freedom of speech? To this, I say no, you can't successfully feel the benefits of freedom of speech because the benefits thereof require that you are heard by somebody, and that cannot happen if it is lost in a vacuum chamber.

So, think of this subreddit as this chamber that could potentially become a vacuum for certain voices under certain conditions. The Mods of this Subbreddit are doing their best to protect this from becoming an ""in space, nobody can hear you scream"" scenario. An example of such protections are included in some of the 10 rules I listed. Let's look at say... 7. Rule 2- Rude/Hostile Comment, in which they are forbidden from being placed on this sub. Isn't this a violation of Freedom of Speech? To prevent people from speaking out in whatever way they want? No calling of other fellow redditors names or placing on them negative adjective describing their lowered mental state?

In answer, yes, it is a violation of the freedom of speech. However, the allowance of such behavior as such creates a vacuum strong enough to take the purpose of this sub off the rails: a place to respectfully debate the possible views one could take on any issue. That aspect of respect is lost, and all of a sudden many comments lose meaning to the conversation and become a perpetual back and forth of nonsense. Don't believe me? Look at some of the other comments on other subs talking about controversial issues. They certainly aren't positive.

**Therefore,** in short, in order to protect the purpose of the freedom of speech, certain aspects of it must be taken. Otherwise, the very purpose of it would not exist.

And thus this rule on the temporary ban of posts pertaining on COVID-19 on this sub is an extra measure of protection from not only the purpose of freedom of speech, but also the purpose of this sub."	0	1585376111.0	/r/changemyview/comments/fq02gk/meta_temporary_suspension_of_covid19coronavirus/flq215t/	1	"None of those rules forbid a topic  however that wasn t my point  My point was that there already are rules on this sub that stop people from saying whatever they want without risk of it being taken down

This is exactly what I'm against. Even in the worst case, do nothing, scenarios, actual scientists estimate that only about 2.5 million people (US) would die (citation: Imperial College Covid 19 response team, 2020). People like you need to stop wildly pulling numbers out of your ass and fear mongering. 

But no, I don't think ""I know better than the doctors."" My position is that the government should make informed policy decisions based on data and analysis. And that includes doing a cost benefit analysis as to whether more people would die from shutting down the economy than would die from doing nothing (or any of the infinite policies in between, get proposals, analyze, find the best one). My back of the napkin estimates say probably not, so long as we don't exceed 30% unemployment, long term, shutting down the economy will save more lives than it kills. But I don't want my back of the napkin estimates, I want the government to hire a team of scientists (medical, economic, and all other kinds they think might have useful information) to do cost benefit analysis on policies before we enact them. 

But apparently advocating for science based policy is absurd and government should just fly by the seat of their pants, because every time I suggest this people just go crazy and think I want to kill their grandmother. I don't want your grandmother to die, I just want science based policy. 

Edit: Or even if they'd just said ""yes we're going to shut the economy down, temporarily, for two weeks say, while we evaluate our options and then at the end of two weeks, we'll come out with our recommendations for the best path forward."" Totally fine. It's an emergency, you don't know what to do, so just hit pause while you figure it out. Instead, we're getting this indefinite shutdown (3 months to 1.5 years based on the estimates I've heard, but no one really knows), making ad hoc policies based on how we feel at the moment, with no regard to the costs or benefits of the action, just we have to do something so ""tens of millions, no hundreds, no we're all gonna die please God help us"" of people don't die."	2	1585402432.0	/r/changemyview/comments/fq02gk/meta_temporary_suspension_of_covid19coronavirus/flqp3ve/	0	" Let s just let tens of millions of people die

META: Temporary suspension of COVID-19/Coronavirus related posts (Effective March 27, 2020)		t5_2w2s8	"I'm not necessarily suggesting that you as moderators are beholden to the results of the polls in any way. However I do think that more transparency in terms of how and why decisions are being made and better insight into what the community actually thinks about those decisions is important, particularly in a sub like this that is very heavily moderated.

I understand that each sub is a specific thing and that the goal of moderation should be to make sure that it stays true to that goal. That doesn't mean that everyone agrees on how to do that though, or even the specifics of what the goal itself.

Personally I don't think this sub quite hits the mark in terms of its stated mission because of the implementation via rules and moderation. You say expect a conversation, but have set it up so that the format is VERY much a debate with lots of people nitpicking just so that they can snag a delta (which in some cases they actively try and tell OP to give them). In fact the whole idea of deltas really runs counter to the idea of it being a conversation rather than a debate and sets a very pedantic and adversarial tone to many posts which probably dissuades people from posting. My personal opinion is that what I want is what the stated goal for the sub is, but the sub is too heavily moderated with rules that are too restrictive to ever achieve the conversational exchange of perspectives suggested by the description of the sub.

Moving all meta discussions to a separate sub ensures that casual members of the community won't see them. You are biasing your input to be only from the most vocal and involved contingent.

I understand that each sub is a specific thing and that the goal of moderation should be to make sure that it stays true to that goal  That doesn t mean that everyone agrees on how to do that though  or even the specifics of what the goal itself 

Personally I don t think this sub quite hits the mark in terms of its stated mission because of the implementation via rules and moderation  You say expect a conversation  but have set it up so that the format is VERY much a debate with lots of people nitpicking just so that they can snag a delta  which in some cases they actively try and tell OP to give them   In fact the whole idea of deltas really runs counter to the idea of it being a conversation rather than a debate and sets a very pedantic and adversarial tone to many posts which probably dissuades people from posting  My personal opinion is that what I want is what the stated goal for the sub is  but the sub is too heavily moderated with rules that are too restrictive to ever achieve the conversational exchange of perspectives suggested by the description of the sub 

Moving all meta discussions to a separate sub ensures that casual members of the community won t see them  You are biasing your input to be only from the most vocal and involved contingent  It effectively ensures that the vast majority of community members aren t contributing to meta discussions  which I have a hard time seeing any good arguments for  It s quite possible that more community members would be more active if the rules and moderation better suited them  but by moving the meta discussion somewhere they aren t likely to see it you ensure that their continued low participation  Again I m not actually suggesting that you be beholden to the community in any democratic way  but I don t see how you can reasonably have a grasp of how changes in moderation are perceived by the community if feedback is so heavily biased towards such a small portion of the community "

None of your justifications are substantive.

If a fundamental part of your sub is actively impeding the success of the stated mission of the sub then it should be ""up for change"". The fact that you won't even consider taking feedback on it is utterly ridiculous, especially given that it wasn't always part of the sub. Does the delta system actually encourage conversational sharing of other perspectives, or does it encourage a more pedantic debate-like argumentative tone? How do you actually know? Have you tried to actually gauge this? Even if it did work when it was first implemented, does it still work now?

> We are open to suggestion, but having countless threads just complaining about this or that is distracting to the purpose of the sub.

This sub has an insanely low engagement rate for a sub where there entire point is active discussion. There are so few posts at all that the idea of meta posts being distracting is absurd. How distracting can they possibly be from the five posts an hour during peak times? It's just a really bad argument.

Depends.  Generally speaking, mods last a couple of months or for years.  If you make it through the first 6 months or so (which about half usually do) then you tend to stick around.

>The list shows that most of the mods are less than a year old, but the one on top is 6 years old. Where are the 2-5 year old mods? Did they vanish for some reason? Fired? Burnt out? Fell through the Earth? Happier elsewhere? 

When our founder left a year or so ago, we had the Admins reorder the list, so that our elected replacement would have the 'top mod' spot.  The only way they could do this was to remove us all and re-add us, which killed our tenure dates.

Case in point, I've been a mod since March 2017

>What is the workload for a new mod? Are they expected to shoulder more work than other mods?

We ask that each mod contribute to at least 1% of the total moderator actions a month.  That is, give or take, about 4 removals/approvals a day.

>How often does a mod get cussed at?   

I'll be straight with you.  A lot.  People don't like us, and you will get your fair share of abuse.  Most of us just deal with it, but if that is a deal breaker we understand

>What do mods do exactly? Read posts? Answer questions? Are they close friends with admins?

We basically keep the sub free of rule-breaking comments and evaluate appeals for people who feel that a removal was a mistake.  We do answer questions from time to time, and we don't really know the admins all that well (though I have had a couple of Skype calls over the years with a few).

When our founder left a year or so ago  we had the Admins reorder the list  so that our elected replacement would have the  top mod  spot   The only way they could do this was to remove us all and re add us  which killed our tenure dates 

Case in point  I ve been a mod since March 2017

 What is the workload for a new mod  Are they expected to shoulder more work than other mods 

We ask that each mod contribute to at least 1  of the total moderator actions a month   That is  give or take  about 4 removals approvals a day 

 How often does a mod get cussed at    

I ll be straight with you   A lot   People don t like us  and you will get your fair share of abuse   Most of us just deal with it  but if that is a deal breaker we understand

 What do mods do exactly  Read posts  Answer questions  Are they close friends with admins 

We basically keep the sub free of rule breaking comments and evaluate appeals for people who feel that a removal was a mistake   We do answer questions from time to time  and we don t really know the admins all that well  though I have had a couple of Skype calls over the years with a few  

 Do mods get into arguments and how are they resolved 

Generally  no   We disagree from time to time  but it is almost always civil   We are a straight democracy behind the scenes  so we all agree that consensus rules "

We tend to invite maybe a dozen mods a year, and half of that make it past the first 6 months before they decide it’s not for them (which is fair). 

>The list shows that most of the mods are less than a year old, but the one on top is 6 years old. Where are the 2-5 year old mods? Did they vanish for some reason? Fired? Burnt out? Fell through the Earth? Happier elsewhere? 

See Ansuz’s answer. I’ve modded for 2 years, but due to the reorg, our tenure dates got flipped. 

>What is the workload for a new mod? Are they expected to shoulder more work than other mods?

All mods have the same expectation of 1% of modqueue. That’s about 5 actions a day, which takes maybe 5 min or less. Optimally everyone would do more (since we don’t have 100 mods) but that’s the minimum. 

>How often does a mod get cussed at? 


Too often unfortunately. Maybe once a week? Something really nasty monthly but most people are more angry than creative. 

>•  What do mods do exactly? Read posts? Answer questions? Are they close friends with admins?

I meant to say 3-4 actions, just to get that out of the way.

New mods _tend_ to do more, but that is just because being a mod is fun and exciting at first.  They eventually settle into a sustainable amount of work.

Some of us do more than the others, but that tends to ebb and flow.  I'm usually one of the more active mods, but I've had to pull back this month due to work and the other mods pick up the slack.

>Have you ever felt burnt out? If you don't mind me asking, have you ever considered leaving (since apparently half the people quit after a while)?

I don't mind at all.  Yeah, I get burnt out from time to time, and I've learned how to manage that.  I don't tend to moderate in the evenings or on weekends, so that has been the right balance for me to do this long term.  Other mods have different strategies.

I don't usually think about leaving, though it has crossed my mind from time to time, usually when a particularly offended user desides to harass me personally.  Thankfully, that occurrence is pretty rare.

>What is the best thing that you get out of the job? What is the worst experience you had on the job?

Best was when I was interviewed by NPR for a Planet Money segment.  Was cool to get to talk about what we do here and how it helps.

Worst was when I was doxxed.  Thankfully, nothing came of it but it is scary when you get a PM with a link to your address...

>What advice could you give to a new mod? Are there mistakes beginners tend to make? Any red flags to watch out for when interacting with users? Are there risks being a mod could bring?

The advice I tend to give is don't be afraid of making mistakes - we are all human and they are going to happen.  At the same time, own your mistakes and don't be too proud to admit you made one.  I'm wrong a lot, and I own that.

Beginners tend to do too much too often, which can lead to burn out.  A sustainable level of work is better for everyone than bursts of productivity followed by burnout.

As for interacting with users, be polite and open, but know when to end the conversation.  Some people just want to argue, and will happily troll you until you give up.  Learning to identify where to spend your time is a skill.

Risks - there are a few.  I won't like - there are vindictive users out there and I was doxxed by one.

Best thing is the sense that this is a cool community. I enjoy reading the posts, even the ones that end up breaking the rules and have to be removed. It's cool to see opinions being shared, and I have changed my opinion and have broadened my views on a lot of things because of this sub. 

Worst experience, not quite sure to be honest. Cursing and nasty PMs are part of the trade, but they're not something that one couldn't ignore. I do get burned out, so that definitely is a problem sometimes.

New mod advice, remember that every other user is a human except proven otherwise, and be prepared to defend why you removed a post/comment in modmail, because more than likely the users that get their stuff removed come to modmail about it. And if you're wrong, just admit it and move on. It's no biggie, we all do it. 

General mistakes, no. Each new mod is different. And I'm new considering I've only been here maybe 9 months or so.

There's definitely a pretty wide range in how active people are.  Of course we can't have everyone do 1%.  That's more to prevent a trend where mods have lost their mojo, but still want to be on the mod roll.  We are very lenient - life happens, people have babies, start new jobs, get sick - but we just don't want people to stay on forever by default - I don't think that's fair to the people who are doing the work.

I do think there's a bit of a ""new mod smell"" - some really just get into it at first and just kill it, but then dial it back over the years.  Others are very inconsistent, which is fine.  Others have less time to devote, and that's ok too.  We do try to recognize internally those who are really contributing the most.  

I've felt burnt out enough to dial back, but never enough to quit.

The best thing is that when it works (which is by no means all the time) I really think CMV can be something special.  Like, I've seen many people really understand something important for the first time - and that's pretty cool.

It sort of makes me laugh when people talk about ""mods on power trips"".  I mean, I'm sure they are out there, but given my choice, there'd be no work to do.  Everyone would follow the rules, be civil, and participate in good faith.  Never having to ban another user or remove another comment would be a blessing, not a disappointment.

But that's not the world we live in.  And I honestly believe that moderation is what makes CMV possible - and so I'm willing to do the work to make it happen.  It also helps that the mod team is made up of a bunch of very smart, funny reasonable people.

The worst experience was with one mod that went rogue.  I've been a mod for most of CMV's existence, and this was the only real issue with that - but it was pretty ugly.

As for advice, honestly, most of it is part of our rules already - receiving hostility is no excuse to be hostile in return.  Be reasonable.  

If you are thin skinned, this probably isn't a great job for you.  I've been called a shill by both sides of any argument over the years, and some pretty horrible things.  

As for risks - I suppose a psycho user could doxx you.  If you were selected to be a mod, you could create an alt to use for moderation if you would feel more comfortable - but we haven't really run into that."	1	1590009378.0	/r/changemyview/comments/gmm9jd/rchangemyview_is_looking_for_new_moderators/fra5jk7/	0	" There are about 20 mods  What happens to the remaining 80  work if everyone does the minimum  Do new mods tend to do more

I'm an ex mod, so I can chime in. 

I started moderating when I decided to help out with the Deltabot script. I mostly updated the code, ran it from my computer, and generally kept it maintained and dealt with issues (like the time it got caught in a loop and endlessly granted deltas to one guy, lol), but the top mod at the time had some ideas for new features and I started getting bogged down with life and didn't have time to update it. I tried doing my fair share of moderation too, but I just didn't have time to keep up after a while. 

In 2017 I had a baby, and my free time was brought down to essentially 0. Other people who were more adept at python scripting had started taking over Deltabot's maintenance and features, and since I wasn't going to be maintaining deltabot anymore and I didn't have time to moderate I decided there wasn't much value in keeping me on the mod role so I stepped down. 

For me personally, removing comments always felt more ""negative"" than participating in discussions.

Modmail discussions were fun. I miss being accused of being a hardcore left winger and hardcore right winger in the span of a single day :) I do still pay closer attention to the opinions of other CMV mods when browsing the subreddit.

Sorry, I don't quite understand. 

Do you mean that there is no fixed amount of work per month, and that the total moderation volume is dependent on what each mod decides to be sufficient, added together? 

I.e. If mod X says ""I made 1 removal, that is my work for this month"", and if mod Y says ""I made 3 removals, that is my work for this month"", there would be 4 total removals. Mod X would have done 25% of the work and mod Y 75%.

There is no hard coded minimum, and that if the mods did 10k actions in June, there is nothing to prevent them from doing 5k actions in July, aside from the individual mod's worry of not knowing how much the others are doing? Is this game theory?

CMV: Ben Shapiro Isn't a Good Debator		t5_2w2s8	"> The funny part is I used to like this guy. I thought he was intelligent and well-spoken. I think this is the general trap that the Ben Shapiro supporter falls into. They automatically assume that because he's confident and speaks competently and quickly that what he's saying is true. However, when you take the time to actually look at the way he argues it's incredibly bad-faith and very transparent. I'm 100% sure that if he tried to pull any of this shit on a competent debater who knows these tactics he would be absolutely destroyed.

The Shapster's debating skills are irrelevant to his commercial mission. Or rather, he has exactly the sort of debating skills that are relevant to his profession. It's better to consider him an entertainer than anything else. If entertainers like him end up as influential political forces, it's more a testament to how reality is becoming less and less important to politics rather than a problem specifically about Ben.

CMV: Ben Shapiro Isn't a Good Debator		t5_2w2s8	"If your issue is with his logic, then your view is actually, “Ben Shapiro isn’t a good philosopher.” It falls on philosophers to exhibit sound logic. A debater’s job is just to craft a convincing argument. What qualifies as a convincing argument differs for everyone. While philosophers may debate, not all debaters are philosophers. See: presidential debates (also good source for what a bad debate looks like).

You said you feel he won the only legitimate debate you’ve watched. But you paint him (intentionally or not) as a sort of bully for “DESTROYING” college kids. The fact is, he’s a public speaker and allows questions at the end of his speeches. He allows people with disagreeing viewpoints to come to the front of the line, which I think is respectable and more than a lot of public figures are willing to do. That said, those conversations don’t qualify as debates and are about as appropriate for judging debate skills as any random argument you may have walking down the street. He has had other more conventional debates. I’d urge you to look them up if for no other reason than to have more source material for your claim that he isn’t a good debater.

That was a mess, but my points in summary: he is a bad philosopher but a good debater. Philosophers are good debaters but that does not mean a good debater must be a good philosopher.

He's very attractive, not just to Republicans but also to centrists. The reason for this is because unlike almost everyone else in politics he doesn't make everything into a political issue. For example, he was never a fan of Trump even in the beginning even though most Republicans supported him because they felt they had too. He's not afraid to criticize his own party when he feels they are wrong. Obviously there are very large issues in which he agrees with the right like abortion but at the end of the day I think that the fact that he doesn't blindly follow his party makes him seem very intelligent (and a good debator) by a lot of people.	1	1589993459.0	/r/changemyview/comments/gncuxa/cmv_ben_shapiro_isnt_a_good_debator/fr98kix/	0	A lot of people here are saying that Ben is just a figurehead for the right but I want to just add a point  He s very attractive  not just to Republicans but also to centrists  The reason for this is because unlike almost everyone else in politics he doesn t make everything into a political issue  For example  he was never a fan of Trump even in the beginning even though most Republicans supported him because they felt they had too  He s not afraid to criticize his own party when he feels they are wrong  Obviously there are very large issues in which he agrees with the right like abortion but at the end of the day I think that the fact that he doesn t blindly follow his party makes him seem very intelligent  and a good debator  by a lot of people

CMV: Ben Shapiro Isn't a Good Debator		t5_2w2s8	">The best example of this is him saying ""science is the reason life begins at conception"" without actually defending this point with actual scientific evidence. 

I think you are getting a few things mixed up. First, a fetus is a living thing. Life has started. When sperm meets egg there is new life. That is scientifically accurate. His statement is accurate there. And it's something people who are in favor of pro choice often get hung up on when debating pro-life individuals. When pro Choice individuals are talking about ""life"" they are talking about when has this life become a moral equivalent of a human where as Ben in this case is talking about life in a scientific sense. 

>What he's really saying here is ""Science says that a sperm and an egg cell turn into a fetus at conception. I think this is when life begins based on personal beliefs that have nothing to do with science.

That's not really accurate. Life has started. It's not personal belief and it is scientifically supported. But that fact really is unimportant because it's not really the spirit of the question being asked. The IMPORTANT question is when do we consider that life valuable and morally equivalent to a person. Is it at birth, conception or somewhere in-between. Whether that is a life has value is not a scientific question.  That's more of a philosophical one. 

Ben is suggesting that he assigns that value to life the moment it begins which is at conception. Ben is trying to avoid debating his actual opinion by trying to frame the debate around facts. He's trying to debate when life begins scientifically rather than debate why he assigns the value to that point which is the real question. When the question is really brought back to the main point of fetus vs Baby he will use an example of when his wife was pregnant and their baby was ""Kicking the crap out of her"".

CMV: Ben Shapiro Isn't a Good Debator		t5_2w2s8	"I have 2 arguments for you to consider. 

First: A good debater is not an honest debater. Truth and debating skill have almost nothing in common. The art of debating concerns itself with managing to argue your side, whichever one it may be, and convining others your side is the true one. That's all there is to debating.

What do you do if your side is disadvantaged? You think Ben, being a lawyer who sometimes defended people blatantly guilty, should have just said ""you know fair enough he is objectively a murderer gg let's go home""? 

Does he win his arguments? He does. Whether you dislike his technique or not. Does he convince most people he wins his arguments? Again, he does. Even you admitted he won, despite disliking how he won.

My second point is you think these issues he debates are clear cut and objectively true/wrong when that is not true. People would have gotten to the truth and we would not debate it anymore if we found some unquestionable truth on the topics of:
-when life starts, 
-whether gender and sex are the same thing or not, 
-what good values in society should be, 
etc etc etc.

You think your side is true (ex. being pro-choice) and he is wrong, and fair enough. But there is no objective truth that he is trying to deceive people from. He is arguing his take on life. The fact that biological life starts at conception is where his belief that abortion is wrong comes from. Agree with it or not, you do have to accept that this is not a settled matter and he is speculating to distract you from it. If all life is sacred, then that is his argument. Maybe not one you agree with, but you don't have a counterargument based on biological fact and science backing your pro-choice stance the way he does."	1	1589994670.0	/r/changemyview/comments/gncuxa/cmv_ben_shapiro_isnt_a_good_debator/fr9b53h/	0	"I have 2 arguments for you to consider

How would you define what makes a good debater? Debate is a somewhat poor method of arriving at the truth, because it happens live, which doesn’t allow participants to research their rebuttals. Skill in debate relies heavily on memory and speed of recall, rather than a solid grasp of objective truth. 

In this context, one could consider Shapiro a good debater, even if he’s full of shit, simply because he’s quick. In other comments, you’ve noted that Shapiro’s opponents performed poorly because they lacked sufficient research. This depends on if you define a good debater as “effective” or “correct”.

You’ve also stated that he uses a lot of logical fallacies. Again, not having watched much debate, are debates typically held in controlled scenarios where a moderator will call this out or is it left to the opponent to call out logical fallacies in their opponent? If the latter, then I can see how this would be a bit like playing soccer and having your opponent constantly being offside or using his hands, and you’re responsible for not just playing against him but also refereeing him. Obviously a soccer team that always wins but doesn’t follow the rules hasn’t demonstrated themselves as a good soccer team.

Despite the fact that you yourself cited a fair engagement that Shapiro came out on top.of, wherein each party abided by similar rules and had equal preparation opportunity.

Further, you seem to shift between Shapiro's debating ability and Shapiro's intelligence. Let's address these separately.

First, intelligence. He graduated high school, age 16, summa cum laude. By 23, he graduated from harvard law cum laude with a doctorate. 10 books written, successful career, business owner, and he commands speaking fees greater than the median annual salary in america. It is hard to argue that he is not at the high end of the bell curve where intelligence is concerned. You may not agree with his points or his reasoning, but Shapiro's intelligence (and work ethic) should be a relatively settled matter.

Now, debating ability. Shapiro himself has referenced the need to understand the goal when debating.  Are you trying to change the mind of your opponent? Sway a crowd? Energize a base? Each of these require different tactics. To generalize about how Shapiro would perform in a formal debate based on how he treats debates for other purposes would be like evaluating a boxer's fighting ability based on how he handled himself during a home invasion.

As I am relatively sure that harvard law requires people be competent and persuasive to graduate, and he did graduate from that doctorate program, 7 years after graduating high school. The bare minimum we can safely assume is that Shapiro's feats in that field point to, at bare minimum, competency in persuasive speaking and debate. This is further evidenced by his clear success within his industry, which is based around public speaking.

CMV: Ben Shapiro Isn't a Good Debator		t5_2w2s8	"It appears your view is ""good debaters are logical in my eyes"". Ben is SUPER logical, he just uses logical tricks that are confusing to most people.

The best thing i can provide is a video that breaks down his approaches very well: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JY5t6iUzajk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JY5t6iUzajk)

So what Ben does, is he isn't debating what your topic/concept is, he is debating your approach. This is what debate is about. I think you (and others) confuse what he does with intellectual curiosity and exploration and the pursuit of truth. It's not, it's about confusing your opponent and tripping them up with rhetorical trip wire. He's great at it.

Reading through the comments it feels like you're saying something like ""I define X as Y, Ben does X as Z, therefore Ben is bad at X"". I believe you are changing the goal posts on what a ""good debater"" is to claim Ben is bad at debate. 

I've never seen/heard anywhere that debate is the pursuit of truth. It's a rhetorical sport, just like how being good at sharp shooting or wrestling or whatever sport doesn't make you a good at the real life uses that the activity is derived from. This would be like saying ""X basketball team are bad at basketball"" because good at basketball is defined as what the Harlem Globe Trotters do. Or you could reverse that ""The Harlem Globe Trotters are the worst competitive basketball team because they've won zero NBA Finals"".

Your frustrations about people trotting out Ben Shaprio is understandable, but maybe you should focus on the fact that he's using rhetorical tricks not pursuit of the truth. i don't know if anyone would claim that's he's pursuing the truth and having honest and open dialog in any of these discussions. He's not doing CMW when he has debates, and that's never his goal."	1	1590003866.0	/r/changemyview/comments/gncuxa/cmv_ben_shapiro_isnt_a_good_debator/fr9ugtd/	0	"It appears your view is  good debaters are logical in my eyes   Ben is SUPER logical  he just uses logical tricks that are confusing to most people

CMV: Ben Shapiro Isn't a Good Debator		t5_2w2s8	"In the end, an argument serves to convert the opinion of others. We’re doing that, right now, about arguing. 

Problem is that I think we’re getting things a little complicated here. 

There’s arguing for the sake of showing how well you can debate, and arguing to get your point out there for others to listen to, either in an informative or entertaining way.

The way you are looking at it, Benji sucks at arguing because he’s not using logic or reason to the best of his ability to combat his opponent, and change their mind. 

The problem with your belief though, is that you can’t apply logic and reason to things that are fundamentally flawed. In other words, if he’s going to argue that no law should force anyone to use preferred pronouns, a ton of people can agree with that, both sides of the aisle can agree that laws shouldn’t dictate what you say. He then goes on to support these claims with more outrageous claims, building support from folks who agree that laws can’t do that, but it would be really hard for me to accept there’s any sort of large movement out there advocating for those kinds of laws.

He makes an argument that’s super easy to agree with, and banks on his underprepared opponents to not be able to call him out before he can shut down their argument.

This is his tactic, now it’s up to you to determine whether or not that makes him good at arguing.

Arguing in real life doesn’t really feel a lot like arguing at a podium. You can’t bring your materials or sources everywhere you go (you can but that would be weird) and you can’t argue any one side of anything when it’s you versus a crowd. He’s been “owned” pretty hard in the right settings, because he couldn’t ambush, talk over, or intimidate his opponent. 

So for these reasons, we can’t use usual metrics to determine his skill. We can, but if you consider winning an argument of gaining support for your cause as determining factors to ones ability to argue, then the tactics to have done so are negotiable. 

Basically, if he’s still gaining supporters, then he must logically be good at his purpose, which is to gain support. If he’s losing supporters, he’s bad. I don’t know what this kind of surface level determination is called in a technical sense, but if your metric for good arguments don’t mix with your interpretation of his argument style, then this seems to be the best metric for either angle.

I think behind all that, the determination would be up to you. He’s good at entertaining, and offending, and his opponents often quit. So that makes it seem like he’s good at arguing. Does that satisfy your criteria? Not how you described it, but how hard can you inspect an opposite point of view before you have to admit to yourself that it’s your own personal beliefs that will prevent you from remaining objective in your assessment?

In that respect, can your view be changed in the first place? I suppose we’ll find out."	1	1590003979.0	/r/changemyview/comments/gncuxa/cmv_ben_shapiro_isnt_a_good_debator/fr9updi/	0	"In the end  an argument serves to convert the opinion of others  We re doing that  right now  about arguing

You need to learn to try to understand your oppositions behavior. Unique human genetic code is created at conception. How do you define a new person biologically? Sure there's probably many different ways to do this, but it's undeniable, that every aspect of your ""nature"" (as opposed to nurture) is defined at conception. This is what science says. What you actually disagree with is whether it's okay to terminate this particular organic life while it is in early gestation, and how you morally approach this issue.

CMV: Ben Shapiro Isn't a Good Debator		t5_2w2s8	"I’m not so sure you are really open to changing your view here, but I will give you my counter argument. 

I think a lot of the tactics you are referring to are in direct response to the questions asked and the way they are asked. Many of his speaking engagements are disrupted with shouting, and many of the questions posed are posed in a way that is not a genuine invitation for debate, but more in a “gotcha” style. He has learned to combat one-liners with one-liners. And the reality is, most of the videos you are talking about are in relatively hostile environments (universities) towards his point of view (even though I concede that his audience is mostly made up of people more like minded to him). I don’t believe he is trying to formulate extremely thorough defenses of his political viewpoint. He is playing politics. 

You may disagree with his debate topics and his point of view, but to suggest that he “traps” followers is quite extreme. He is very well spoken, articulates his points well, and is very quick-witted. If you really follow him, you learn that he is willing to call out crap when he sees it (he routinely calls out trump on his bullshit, but he also routinely calls out the media on theirs), he has very well formed opinions (even if you disagree with his conclusions), and I believe he does (or at least he used to before he became famous) want what is best for the country (again, even if you disagree with his methodology or conclusions). He is willing to engage earnestly with people who disagree with him when they give him the same type of respect and earnest engagement. 

My question to you is: do you have any examples of conservative pundits that you believe are better than him? Or at least “better debaters?” 

It really doesn’t matter in the context of this CMV, but I suppose it helps establish the sincerity of this exchange. If you just think conservatism itself is just shit, then are you even trying to engage? Or just shit on Ben Shapiro and people you think are wrong?

Begging the question, ad hominem attacks, straw man arguments, whataboutism, the list goes on and most people are guilty of at least one, but in listening to Shapiro i hear every single one of these engaged and used with frequency. False comparison especially.

CMV: Ben Shapiro Isn't a Good Debator		t5_2w2s8	"I think it really depends on what you consider the purpose of a debate to be. Personally, I believe a debate should be more of a comparison between ideals and the rational behind our ideologies. I think that debates should be used more to find a common ground, or maybe spawn whole new concepts, rather than cause more of a rift. The problem is some people have this idea that debating is just a battle of ideals, and the one who is more right is obviously ""the winner"" because lots of people, on all sides of things, like to think ""I am right and everyone else is wrong."" Since there is no easy way to prove who is right most debate formats, the ""winner"" typically ends being whomever sounds more right. Ben Shapiro is good at sounding more right. Since a lot of people consider sounding more right winning a debate, a lot of people consider Ben Shapiro good at debating.
  
I think a better CMV would be to say that debating in its current format is completely useless when it comes to proving any kind of ""right or wrong."" Modern debates are nothing more than dog and pony shows to make the debater and their target audience feel superior, and mostly used nowadays simply to promote ideas that typically don't hold any water.  

And, not to be hypocritical, I should point out this sub runs into a lot of the same problems you run into with debating, but I believe the CMV format does help quite a bit surprisingly by encouraging others not just to prove their point but simply to play devil's advocate. Most delta's are handed out not because a view was actually changed but because the response was one that could not be easily dismissed.

 I ended up working at Goodwin Procter for 10 months  It was a real estate law firm and I joined just before the real estate crash   And I was sitting there for ten hours a day doing nothing  because there s no work  I tend to be a fast worker I write incredibly quickly  see e g this conversation   And they would tell me  you need to slow down  review the documents four and five times   Basically  bulk up your hours    
   
 And when they told me that one too many times  and were pissed that I missed a page number  I said  I m out  I quit   And that too was a funny story   They called in another senior associate to have a conversation with me about why I shouldn t quit   He came in and told me how he had been a minor league baseball player but ended up giving it up for the law   I told him that minor league baseball sounded like a lot more fun   One thing led to another and the entire session quickly morphed into Goodwin trying to talk the senior out of quitting to go back to playing baseball  "

CMV: Ben Shapiro Isn't a Good Debator		t5_2w2s8	"I think you’re unintentionally pointing out exactly why Ben Shapiro is only good at debating on a surface level, and when it starts getting fundamental he starts falling apart.

Let me start by saying I hope that Ben Shapiros abortion argument isn’t as fallacious as you’re making it seem, but for the purposes of this exercise it’s worth pointing out the flaw in at least your perception of his view. 

Let’s take that statement “Science says life begins at conception, therefore abortion is immoral”. Let’s assume that the first part of the statement is true. Scientists do define life as self replicating organisms, although it can be more complex than that (viruses for example). So objectively, life seems to begin at conception. But a tree is also alive. What does life have to do with abortion? 

Those who argue that abortion from conception is immoral use the shorthand “life begins at conception” to argue that from the moment a fetus is conceived they are deserving of the full right to life. This has nothing to do with science. It is a very contentious field of philosophy.

So proving in a scientific sense that life begins at conceptions provides almost no support for the philosophical shorthand of “life begins at Conception”. Yet your version of Ben Shapiro is willing to equivocate those two definitions in order to “win the debate”.

An appeal to science in the abortion debate must be within the context of the philosophical definition of the “right to life”, otherwise it is equivocation. If Ben Shapiro is seriously arguing that the fact that a self replicating organism is alive means something significant about abortion, I wonder how he’s still breathing. What would he eat? Plants and animals are clearly alive, killing them must be immoral."	1	1589992108.0	/r/changemyview/comments/gncuxa/cmv_ben_shapiro_isnt_a_good_debator/fr95pm4/	0	"I think you re unintentionally pointing out exactly why Ben Shapiro is only good at debating on a surface level  and when it starts getting fundamental he starts falling apart

There is a difference: it implies that there is a second media layer where a different reality can actively coexist and interact with the first one. Generally (but not always) the things people do or say on the internet are quite different from what they do in their real life interactions. Previously, before mass-media, you could very well make decisions not based on facts (and facts themselves can be interpreted in various ways) but you would mostly evolve and interact in real life and get your beliefs and facts from there. With newspapers, you get the start of the second layer but it's still quite weak since there's only so much info there and only so much interaction that can come out of it.

CMV: Ben Shapiro Isn't a Good Debator		t5_2w2s8	"I can't imagine you've never seen it, but [this debate](https://youtu.be/c4kbF7mvBWo) is a pretty good example of Ben making a persuasive point imo. Regardless of whether or not you think he's right, what he's saying has true bearing in the debate. I don't think the fact that his motives are, in part, to stir up controversy for notoriety necessarily detract from his points. Milo Yiannopoulos, for example, took that tactic pretty close to its practical extreme, and is pretty starkly different from Ben because of that. As a politically neutral, somewhat avid listener of Ben (definitely not so much nowadays, like you), I can say that he doesn't seek to make a spectacle out of everything, but those clips tend to be reproduced and viewed far more often than his civil dialogues.

He's not perfect; in fact, nobody is. He's definitely made some significant blunders. Still, though, there are degrees to being an intellectual, and I don't think using strategy in debate is demeaning of that title when the entire purpose of a debate is to deflate the other side (as an art or form of competition, NOT in the same regard as, say, a scientific debate where the point is to derive the best possible alternative for / in whatever given forum). 

I think saying he's a master-class intellectual is similarly silly to saying he's not an intellectual at all. He's eclectic, high-achieving academically, very vocal and involved in his field. He's definitively a professional. That doesn't mean he's always right. More often than not, you can't be right or wrong in those debates. Political debates are rife with moral gray areas and general uncertainty. At the end of the day, whether or not you think his points are compelling are all contingent on your beliefs. 

Your beliefs are constructed by compounding all of what you've learned. Nobody's political views really changes due to one Earth-shattering realization; it's a slow process of gradual change where what you think you know is weathered down. For that reason, what I'm saying is also unlikely to change your mind, but the point is that there's usually no ultimately ""correct"" answers politically, and simply are differing perspectives which we hold with more or less weight than others."	1	1589999718.0	/r/changemyview/comments/gncuxa/cmv_ben_shapiro_isnt_a_good_debator/fr9lqh7/	1	"I can t imagine you ve never seen it  but  this debate  https   youtu be c4kbF7mvBWo  is a pretty good example of Ben making a persuasive point imo  Regardless of whether or not you think he s right  what he s saying has true bearing in the debate  I don t think the fact that his motives are  in part  to stir up controversy for notoriety necessarily detract from his points  Milo Yiannopoulos  for example  took that tactic pretty close to its practical extreme  and is pretty starkly different from Ben because of that  As a politically neutral  somewhat avid listener of Ben  definitely not so much nowadays  like you   I can say that he doesn t seek to make a spectacle out of everything  but those clips tend to be reproduced and viewed far more often than his civil dialogues

>When most people say life in the context of this debate they mean the point an organism becomes a human being with the moral considerations we give to human beings.

Yes, the moment at which a *human* becomes a *human being* is the essence of the abortion debate from a moralistic standpoint. This moment is in many senses completely arbitrary because the term *human being* and all the moral and legal implications that come with it are subjective. Someone who’s a pro-choice absolutist might say a fetus is not a human being until it intakes its own oxygen. 18th century plantation owners might say their slaves aren’t human beings. Hitler might say a Jew is not a human being.

One sperm + one egg coming together creates a *human* life. A fetus is a living human from conception. It is a collection of attached cells with unique human DNA. By all definitions, this is life. This is a scientific fact and the one Shapiro uses to argue against abortion. It’s not just his opinion. His opinion is that we should use the scientific definition of *human life* as the basis for the moral/societal definition of *human being* and everything that comes with it (your contextually based definition of “life”).

Appealing to science in this way is not a poor debate tactic, actually I think it’s a pretty strong one. Any opponent must either justify a definition of “human being” that is based in something other than the scientific definition of human life, or justify killing a human being (which btw many pro-choice arguments do successfully, the Roe v. Wade decision literally did this). By making this appeal Shapiro has centuries of observation, experimentation, and skeptically analyzed conclusions going for him.

However an interesting coincidence.  I don't know Foucault particularly well.  It [looks like you may be a follower](https://thoughtleader.co.za/bertolivier/2008/09/23/foucault-on-intellectuals/) of his particular belief in intellectuals?  I, in contrast, would not agree with him on this.

I (loosely) like this definition of intellectual:

> a very educated person whose interests are studying and other activities that involve careful thinking and mental effort

In that way, Foucault's status there is unambiguous.  Of course he is.  Shapiro, not so much.  In all fairness, ""political commentary"" doesn't really level as an intellectual pursuit at all.

Let s use Foucault as an example   Yes  his historical analysis is controversial   I ve never heard  anyone  refer to him as not an intellectual 

However an interesting coincidence   I don t know Foucault particularly well   It  looks like you may be a follower  https   thoughtleader co za bertolivier 2008 09 23 foucault on intellectuals   of his particular belief in intellectuals   I  in contrast  would not agree with him on this 

I  loosely  like this definition of intellectual 

  a very educated person whose interests are studying and other activities that involve careful thinking and mental effort

In that way  Foucault s status there is unambiguous   Of course he is   Shapiro  not so much   In all fairness   political commentary  doesn t really level as an intellectual pursuit at all

CMV: Ben Shapiro Isn't a Good Debator		t5_2w2s8	"I think you have to think about the nature of debate as professed by OP. 

In colloquial terms, a good debater is typically the person who comes out looking right, regardless of the underlying truth to their position.

OP seems to be defining a good debater as someone who supports their views with evidence and shows their position to be fundamentally true.

I think we can all agree that under the first definition Ben Shapiro is a good debater. He's convinced many people that he is a debate god, which is by definition all it takes to be a good debater.

OP is arguing that under the second definition Ben Shapiro is not a good debater. I think the best rebuttal is that Shapiro typically does support his viewpoints with evidence when he is engaging in a debate seriously. He rarely does so, because it is much more lucrative to dunk on college students using fallacious arguments. 

However, he seems to care about truth very little. When he is challenged by a serious debater who knows their stuff, he falls back on equivocation, gish gallop, attacking their motives, and ""we're just coming from different viewpoints"".

All I see on wiki is that he graduated cum laude, articled (clerked, similar to an internship) at a law firm and that he has a legal consultancy which doesn't really mean much other than he probably has an LLC registered. 


>You don't do that by being inarticulate or unable to argue a point.

I don't think that's the argument, though. And maybe OP should make an edit or something and perhaps define what they consider a ""good debater"" to be. 

I think it's probably correct to say that what Shapiro wants to do isn't really honest debate but attempt to make liberal arguments sound foolish so his own sound less foolish by comparison. 

While that may be useful for his purposes, it's not really intellectually useful unless you're doing a case study in rhetorical punditry styles. I've read a few things Shapiro has written and watched some of his debates, and they seem to follow the same formula -

Either reframe or miscaracterize an argument and build a strawman around it, then attack his own construction on more favorable terms with a lot of cherry-picked statistics he's memorized that are impossible to refute because no one has whatever information he's using in front of them. Whether or not that's ""good debate"" is I suppose up to the viewer, but I don't think it's unfair to at least call it intellectually dishonest. 

Because look at how frustrated he gets when someone applies logic to his own arguments, like what happened on the BBC. He wrote a book about a topic that he clearly wasn't willing to be challenged on. 

His arguments are nothing I've never heard before. I don't think he really thinks about them deeply enough, and I think *that's* what his legal career better illustrates. 

Like, he's clearly a good student and capable of memorizing things very well. Well enough to graduate Harvard Law with honors.

Rivers form many national borders, but does that make those borders ""scientific?"" Of course not; nation states have nothing to do with science. That's a political decision which uses a geological measurement as an arbitrary but measurable and constant standard.

DNA itself doesn't inform our perception of life. If we all decide that new DNA is the meaning of life, does that actually mean police will start investigating miscarriages as homicides? Would it allow expecting mothers to claim fetuses as dependents on their taxes? Would we count your age from the date of conception rather than your date of birth? Would fetuses be counted in the next census? No, because DNA doesn't actually have anything to do with the disagreement at hand.

CMV: Ben Shapiro Isn't a Good Debator		t5_2w2s8	"Is there a fallacy for switching between different definitions/usages of the same word to further an argument?

When someone says abortion is ending a life and therefore murder, they are using the informal/common definition where “life” means a human life with full moral considerations.

If they start talking about the scientific definition of life, meaning life in the sense that ants, corn, and bacteria are alive, they’re abusing the context switch to try and confuse people who don’t realize life means a totally different thing in this context.

This doesn't invalidate his argument, nor does it mean he is using a logical fallacy. This type of argument is necessary for having the kinds of informal debates Shapiro engages in. It is a place to dive deeper into the philosophy that guides him vs the people debating him.

The way you framed the next step in the argument is a great way to dig into the core of why each of us believe what we do on any issue.

I don't think that people take up the challenge of expanding the debate down to those core issues. But it certainly doesn't mean the point ""life begins at conception"" is incorrect for a pro-lifer. If you disagree with their views, of course you are going to take exception with how they define things. The goal should be to push past the presuppositions people hold to dig into those more core topics and hold a discussion around that.

For example, a pro-choice individual might hold a view that life begins at birth, or when the heart forms, or when the brain forms. How would anyone argue for a position that ""life begins at conception"" without providing some arguments, both philosophical and scientific?

If you don't provide those arguments then when you are trying to argue something like the fundamental value to human life, then the other person could, and probably will, continue to bring up that they believe that ""life begins at birth"" or something like that. That means that the two people hold a fundamentally different view of the start of life that they are not talking about and the debate will never move anywhere.

Not that all debates end up going in a productive direction.  You are right, people can, and do, get hung up on just using ""science"" as a cudgel that they never move past to get to their core worldview.

Like I said before I don't have a solid position on this. Every miscarriage isn't the equivalent of a death. They happen ALL the time. But obviously if a pregnant woman is stabbed resulting in a miscarriage something of value was lost. Personally I'm closest to the opinion that at conception there is value.

The only thing I can think of is if you're trying to hit on people at a bar, but when you're doing that you're in a scene where it's generally accepted people are there to hit on and be hit on, so you have no choice but to assume people are *potentially* straight or else you aren't going to get anywhere - plus, unless it's a very small town, the gay people are likely in the gay bars if they're looking to hit on people. And I think the number of actually straight people is probably lower than it seems, precisely because you would naturally assume someone to be straight until they mention otherwise. But like, the majority of people don't go to college.

If, by ""wrong"", you mean ""immoral"", then the answer is in your post.  Assuming peoples' sexuality is going to upset a lot of people.  It costs you nothing to wait until they mention who they are dating/married to/etc. or mention their sexuality.  Or you could ask them.

Of by ""wrong"" you mean ""factually incorrect"", you're going to be wrong pretty frequently, at least with sexuality.  Most LGB+ people look and act like straight people. I'm bisexual, for example, and I'm married to a woman with a kid.  Nobody in the past 10 years has guessed my sexuality correctly.

The problem with this is that, for the person you're making the assumption about, it's very annoying and tolling.  And it's something they have to deal with very frequently.  For me, for example, everyone assumes I'm straight.  When, over the course of years, I correct them, is very stressful.  You don't know if they're going to say, ""oh, that's fine"", or blow up in your face or physically threaten you or never speak you again.  (I've had all of these happen to me, and it's very difficult to predict how it's going to happen).  One clear signal, for me at least, is that if someone doesn't assume my sexuality, they probably aren't going to threaten me or insult me or stop talking to me. In my experience, that's a safe person to come out to."	1	1589980884.0	/r/changemyview/comments/gn26hs/cmv_im_not_wrong_to_assume_someone_sexsexuality/fr8khbu/	0	"  I know   a lot   of people would be upset for me saying this    I don t think it s wrong to initially think someone is

A- it’s reinforcing norms and expectations. Should you assume somebody is a woman because somebody is in the kitchen? Or that a Dr. Smith is a man? We’ve well done away with that kind of behavior so we’re expanding it to include more attributes, including dress and appearance. It may seem counterintuitive. Think if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it’s a duck. We no longer assume something is a duck because it looks and quacks like a duck. You gotta ask it if it’s a duck. (In which case it will quack).

B- I went to high school with a trans kid. FTM. Jay used to be beat by his parents when we were growing up. Literally attempting to beat the male out of him. By their own words! If you were to walk up to Jay at any point in that transition and say she or miss or ma’am or hun or what have you, it would bring back some terrible memories for Jay. Of course that wouldn’t be your intention, but the hurt would still be there.

C- (really B2) by assuming somebody is gay or straight or trans or cis, you could be putting them in danger. Obviously you wouldn’t mean to, but there are still people out there who marginalize and even commit hate crimes against those they think are different. Even if you’re not speaking it out loud or identifying them by your assumption, there’s a lot of negativity associated with this kind of thinking. People still make assumptions about people’s sexuality and attack them for it. 

D- respect. Somebody who is trans or non-binary is likely proud of their identity. And has worked hard to develop confidence around it as they’ve certainly had their share of bad experiences associated with it. Just give them the respect they’re asking for. Which is for you not to assume anything about them. 

E- I’m a gay female and I try so hard to not assume anybody’s sexuality that I haven’t been on a date in four years HA hilarious so funny

CMV: I'm not wrong to assume someone sex/sexuality.		t5_2w2s8	"I'll give three different arguments/models that might matter for you (shots in the dark!) If any especially resonate or seem unimportant or off, please say so!

Likelihood of the fact of being wrong, i.e. technicality/truth: By definition, assuming makes you wrong exactly as often as your assumptions fail. In the case of assuming non-LGBTQ that would be about 5% of the time, in the general population. Here the question is, ""how right do you want to be?"" At 5% you stand a high chance of mis-assuming at least once at a large party. If you were, let's say, a busy professional encountering 100 people a week, or worked in customer services encountering 100 a day, that would be enough to mis-assume once per business day, or almost once per work hour respectively. That can be costly when the stakes are high.

Otherness-congeniality-sociability-empathy: You may be confusing ""be wrong"" with ""feel bad"". A more cordial/generous perspective would be to find ways to optimize the comfort and happiness of those around you. If you were optimizing for this, then you should feel \*something\* painful for having ""stepped on someone's toes"" and caused them discomfort or pain. In that sense, it is similar to many social slights. Feeling bad about them is quite natural and healthy. Not doing so might even be pathological. It isn't necessarily, ""wrong"" to bump into someone, but that doesn't mean it isn't hurtful (potentially even damaging) or deserving of apology.

Social impact / pragmatic argument: Norms don't always exist to our benefit. Many are seeking to live in a world with norms different than our dominant ones. If you happen to want to encourage such a move, then conducting yourself in a way that implicitly and explicitly challenges those models is the way to do it. Inversely, by conducting yourself in a way that implicitly or explicitly asserts the norm you would be propagating a way of thinking that is, at the best of times, uncomfortable, and often openly antagonistic. The pragmatic argument would have you be wrong if your goal were a change towards normalcy of LGBTQ identity, as you would be working against your end by implying the current norm."	1	1589952900.0	/r/changemyview/comments/gn26hs/cmv_im_not_wrong_to_assume_someone_sexsexuality/fr7oryt/	0	"I ll give three different arguments models that might matter for you  shots in the dark   If any especially resonate or seem unimportant or off  please say so

CMV: I'm not wrong to assume someone sex/sexuality.		t5_2w2s8	It is never really necessary to assume something about someone. Just keep an open mind until either the person provides information about themselves or, if it’s just a brief interaction with a stranger, you never need to know. It is occasionally necessary to guess, because of the limitations of language and not having an appropriate opportunity to ask. But I find that if I’m open to the possibility of being incorrect, I naturally choose words that allow for more flexibility. Where I live, the word “partner” is commonly used, especially when asking other people about their relationships. I find it to be a simple way for people to convey that they’re not homophobic and to not push someone to reveal the gender of their partner if they don’t want to. It has the added advantage of not assuming marital status. Assuming someone’s sex/gender is also not necessary very often, except in cultures where people have to say “sir” and “ma’am” to strangers. While most discussion about misgendering rightfully focuses on transgender people, I have found it amazing how often people misgender me, a cis woman with short hair, which just shows how readily and carelessly some people form assumptions and then stick to them. Most of the time, those people could have said nothing, but they were so sure of themselves that they guessed. At least those situations are, at worst, awkward but as other comments have described, there can be worse consequences.	1	1589961093.0	/r/changemyview/comments/gn26hs/cmv_im_not_wrong_to_assume_someone_sexsexuality/fr7y53s/	0	It is never really necessary to assume something about someone  Just keep an open mind until either the person provides information about themselves or  if it s just a brief interaction with a stranger  you never need to know  It is occasionally necessary to guess  because of the limitations of language and not having an appropriate opportunity to ask  But I find that if I m open to the possibility of being incorrect  I naturally choose words that allow for more flexibility  Where I live  the word  partner  is commonly used  especially when asking other people about their relationships  I find it to be a simple way for people to convey that they re not homophobic and to not push someone to reveal the gender of their partner if they don t want to  It has the added advantage of not assuming marital status  Assuming someone s sex gender is also not necessary very often  except in cultures where people have to say  sir  and  ma am  to strangers  While most discussion about misgendering rightfully focuses on transgender people  I have found it amazing how often people misgender me  a cis woman with short hair  which just shows how readily and carelessly some people form assumptions and then stick to them  Most of the time  those people could have said nothing  but they were so sure of themselves that they guessed  At least those situations are  at worst  awkward but as other comments have described  there can be worse consequences 
CMV: I'm not wrong to assume someone sex/sexuality.		t5_2w2s8	"I used to work in a clinic and saw all walks of people, sometimes trans people would come in and some would identify as a different gender to their identifier on the record (Mr, Mrs, etc)

The first time something like that happened I used the wrong pronoun and the patient stopped me and said ""sorry to be a pain, but its Ms not Mr"". I of course apologised and we moved on from there.

Afterward I was thinking about how embarrassed I was and was thinking about how to not do that again.

I realised that when we talk to a person we very rarely use gendered language with them, we usually use it when we talk about someone else. So I stopped using gendered language in my clinic and it really wasn't a big deal, take this conversation as an example.

""Hi my name is Culturerush, Ill be doing the test with you today, you alright?""

""Im fine thank you""

""Brilliant, what's your name and date of birth""

""Insert name, insert date of birth""

""Okay and what's your address""

""Address""

""Have you ever had an operations on the part of the body Ill be doing the test on?""

""Yeah once back in '99""

""Oh right and can you give me some details on that""

""yeah it was horrible and I don't want it again""

""Great and for the dreaded GDPR are you alright with us transferring your information to individuals involved in your care?""

""No problem""

And so on and so forth. At no point in that conversation did either of us use any gendered language. Most of the time when you need to use it to someone you can very easily get around it. Maybe Ive had practice in that sort of thing because my memory is so bad I forget someones name and what they do as soon as they tell me and Ive become an expert at dodging topics as a result. Either way you can easily avoid gendered language when talking about general stuff and if you do refer to something thats gender specific (like ""How are your testicles today?"") just roll with it, apologise and say you didn't know and move on.

So while unconsciously you might assume someones gender and sexuality there's no need for your language to confer your assumption into the conversation. It can all be kept general enough to avoid it. Theres a big difference between things you think and things you do.

Remember too that trans people likely have to put up with people getting it wrong all the time and while some may very well have the patience of saints, it will get frustrating having a decision you agonised over being accidentally subverted every time someone misgenders you.

In fact sometimes if you assume a trans person’s gender correctly they will be very appreciative, but that’s usually because they are so used to being misgendered. This is why you should really avoid assuming when you are unsure or actually being introduced. Most trans people at some level have gender dysphoria, so if you assume their gender you run the risk of triggering that dysphoria, which comes with high levels of stress and discomfort. And it’s not too hard to ask about pronouns or say your pronouns when you are in the mists of an introduction.

Now you could argue that those individuals who do get misgendered should do a better job presenting as their desired gender but that’s not always an achievable goal, for they might have just transition and haven’t had the adequate amount of time/money to go through the surgeries and medications, or they might be unable for other reasons, or they might even identify as nonbinary and thus getting to the point where people wouldn’t misgendered them is impossible because most people don’t ever assume someone is nonbinary.

In the real world, in my experience, most people who experience being misgendered *don't even acknowledge that it occured.* If anything, and again, just from what I've experienced, the person *might* politely correct you, but *only* if they've already established an acquaintance with you, or, at the very least, a rapport. Or, the person who has been misgendered *erupts in laughter,* perhaps out of pure embarrassment, but certainly doesn't go out of the way to insist that you are wrong for making any assumptions. 

The whole idea that there are **lots** of people out there who would be offended just feeds into the stereotype that anybody who cares about gender issues is just a raving SJW lunatic. People have been ""misgendered"" since the beginning of human history, long before SJW was a term.

Even in online spaces, not face to face encounters, there are communities that are *exhausted* for being misgendered all the time (girl gamers who comment in the mainstream gaming subs, for example), but I think it's extraordinarily rare, in my personal, anecdotal experience, for those people to insist you are wrong for trying to make an assumption in the first place.

But you're clearly not talking about online spaces with language such as this: ""but if a person look like a guy, I'm going to assume he is a guy.""

Have you personally experienced someone in the real world who unironically accused you of being wrong for trying to assume their gender? If so, I'm sorry that happened to you, and I'm also sorry for whoever it was that you offended, they've got a hard road ahead of them to expect people to *never* assume a gender outside of their circles of people who are hyper sensitive and hyper aware of gender issues.

And, at the same time, I think it's fair to say that you, me, and almost everybody in the world, who is an adult that has interacted with copious amounts of other human beings, *has* misgendered people (probably multiple people) but *never knew it,* because *most* people who suffer gender dysphoria really do just keep it to themselves (for better or for worse), and the *last* thing most of these people want is to draw attention to themselves (and paint a target on themselves) by even addressing the topic.

It's like the guys who play online video games and wonder, why don't more girls play games online? The answer is: They *do* play online, half of gamers really are girls, it's really not a boys club, but most of the girls who game online do so with mics muted and with names that aren't obviously feminine, because they just want to decompress and play video games and chill out and not get harassed by the very toxic people so prevalent in online gaming communities.

It's really all /r/onejoke  ... I've had the opportunity to be friends with over 100 people in the LGBTQ spectrum, with a window into the pride community (even a private showing of the first gay marriage exhibit in my home state.  It was so awesome!)

While I'm not saying I'm an authority, I've known people every point in the gender-fluid scale and every point in the LGBTQ-activism scale.  And ZERO of them are offended if you get something wrong.

The gender-offense stereotype is propaganda.  People who are actually batshit about it are *SO* few and far between.

Honestly, I think you're more likely to offend a straight person who happens to be homophobic by assuming they're gay than any other person.  You get it wrong with someone LGBTQ, you usually just get a shrug and ""no I'm gay"" or ""no I'm trans"".  

Having sat through an educational lecture on gender identify (long story, but it was pretty eye-opening), one of the interesting facets that people involved in LGBTQ issues understands better is that sexuality and gender identity are not inter-related.  You can be an effeminite straight man, or a non-queer gay man, or one of a thousand other things.  And in most situations, everyone understands that.

That's why the whole pronoun thing has been getting bigger.  And in all fairness, every time I've been corrected on pronouns (even if it's been repeat-corrected), it's been respectful and polite.  

It's generally not about being offended by mistakes or assumptions.  It's about the people who *refuse to try*.  Someone insists on ""she/her"" and you call them ""him"" willfully (not by error)... that's the real situation where you start to offend people.  And then you would be wrong.  And I've known people like that, with that level of (controversial word) bigotry.  I don't care if it's your religion, or some misguided claimed attribution of biology. If you KNOW someone identifies as a gender, it's only polite to identify them as that gender."	1	1589978494.0	/r/changemyview/comments/gn26hs/cmv_im_not_wrong_to_assume_someone_sexsexuality/fr8gu2g/	0	"What I m going to try to CYV on is  a lot of people would be upset    Because you re right  it s NOT wrong to assume gender sex

CMV: I'm not wrong to assume someone sex/sexuality.		t5_2w2s8	"This has probably been touched on. I admit I did not read the whole thread. My view is this:

The are situations were you have to assume someone's gender and there is nothing wrong with taking your best guess as long as you are willing to be corrected. These situations are perhaps a little more rare than you might think. I talk to randos on the phone every day and sometimes I can't tell from their voice whether I should say sir or ma'am, but if you think about it I could treat every person with friendliness and respect without using either term. The sheer number of people I've talked to over the years make it a statistical certainty that I have misgendered someone with a sir or ma'am and I don't know about it because they didn't care to correct me for whatever reason. Just an example.

In a perfect world, or maybe just a generalized version of this one the way sexual relationships should work is like this:

Person A: *I/my friend likes you romantically. Would you like to explore that with me/my friend?*

Person B: *Thank you for the flattering interest, but no I don't want to pursue a romantic relationship with you/your friend because* (already in a relationship, leaving town soon, unable to have sex for medical reasons, just not up for it right now, or any reason at all, including that Person A or their friend is not of their preferred gender which they can truthfully reveal or not.) OR: *Yes, I also find you/your friend attractive and would also like to explore a romantic/sexual relationship.*

In a perfect world it shouldn't really matter if you don't know their sexual orientation before hand because the question is folded into the bigger question of general interest. Maybe you are the first guy to ask another guy out and they still aren't sure  they are gay but say yes anyway and discover that are bi. Or maybe they consider themselves pansexual, but their choices do reveal a leaning towards a definite type and you might have a different word to describe their sexuality, which may or may not be a useful label to them. Human sexuality is complex, but all you really have to assume is that someone might be into you until they tell you they are not.

This view does assume that everyone is totally cool with all sexual orientations, which is far from the case. Obviously if you are a gay man in, for example, Russia you will obviously want to get some clues and be pretty sure of the situation before you declare your attraction to another man. This stinks.

I come from a small island in England where I grew up around incredibly conservative people and where even bisexual men were treated as though they were aliens. I'm now at university and have met people from all walks of life, including those from this category who formed a group chat all together.

It seems to me from reading other response that your point falls on morality rather than stubbornness, which I do also want to challenge.

I agree that assuming someones gender is fine if you don't have any preconceived notion of that person. For example, someone I met when first attending university looked like a woman and wore exclusively women's clothing; when I approached them and referred to them as ""she"" they corrected me that they identified as non-binary.

In this case, I don't believe I was in the wrong to assume the gender of this person because everything about their person suggested that. However, as I suspect you have done in the past as I have too and wouldn't blame you, you are wrong to assume a gender of someone who is like this off of the bat. For example, attaching a pronoun to an individual mentally when first meeting them sets stereotypes in your head of who this person is from people's upbringings where it was fine to think that - someone called Samantha who looked like a woman would obviously like to talk about boys and wear makeup, right?

Instead, it's better to attach a non-gender specific word to a person. In my case, I assume everyone I meet is ""a person"" until they tell me otherwise. When I talk to anyone I meet for the first time, I either avoid pronouns in a formal setting - ""the person I'm talking about"" - or refer to them as a common word - in my case, being British, I call literally everyone I meet ""mate"", even if I've met them once before in my life.

--------------

When it comes to sexuality, I do think the waters become murky however. If you're sitting at a bar and a woman sits down who you think is attractive, you're not in the wrong to assume she is straight.

I think if we're being cynical we can say that the assumption someone is straight or your sexuality is based on your own wants and immediate surroundings and it's something that can be righted, but I honestly feel as though this isn't an issue when compared to the gender debate.

Again, in my own case I engage in conversation and then just ask straight out if they would feel comfortable sharing their sexuality - if they say ""no"", you can assume they're not what you're looking for.

But, again, that's semantics and I do agree that to assume a sexuality mentally is fine. I've seen extreme people get incredibly upset over it but then I've spoken to others from the community who felt that persons reaction was over the top and would be fine with it. In fact, it seems a minority would become upset with the idea from my personal opinion and those people are looked to as overreacting on an assumption - although, again, this is where the argument gets murky because then you could argue it's what the person is comfortable with that matters but at this point I feel the debate just goes back and forth indefinitely.

Realistically with the sexuality debate, I don't think there is a right answer and so I think you're wrong in that regard for saying that the matter is black and white, however I also think people are wrong for arguing the opposite.

CMV: I'm not wrong to assume someone sex/sexuality.		t5_2w2s8	I think with gender it's ok to assume- there are gender norms and one of the big ways that live our gender reality is by how we present to the world, so if someone presents to the world in a way that appear male, it's fine to assume that I think, but as you say, if they correct you, you'd be an asshole for misgendering them after that. With sexuality however...literally the only thing that determines that is what kind of people you like to fuck, look at etc, not how you dress, talk or act. Best to assume nothing about someone's sexuality until they tell you or see them in a particular act.

So many people, myself included, struggle with people making untrue assumptions about us based on how they perceive our gender or sexuality. There’s a difference between sexuality, gender identity, and gender expression. You might meet a guy with a stereotypically gay voice and feminine mannerisms, but that doesn’t mean he’s gay. You might meet a woman with masculine features and assume she’s trans, but she’s not. We can’t help the impulsive way our brain categorizes people, but when it becomes wrong is when people call into question or interrogate others based on how they perceive their sex/sexuality and it’s wrong and unnecessary.

CMV: I'm not wrong to assume someone sex/sexuality.		t5_2w2s8	"First some terminology: 
1. sex refers to biological features (penis/vagina)
2. gender refers to somebody’s identification (psychologically/mentally)
3. Binary heteronormative construct refers to the idea that marriage is made up of male sex = husband and female sex = wife, which most of society abides to. 


Your view involves two parts:
- what constitutes a ‘wrong’ in this context
- whether or not assuming somebody’s sex/sexuality should be considered as likely to cause such a ‘wrong’. 

It’s very easy, and I think we all agree, to define a wrong as something which causes harm to another. We can also agree that offence can be a form of harm. So we move on to the more important question.

Should the assumption of a person’s gender/sexuality be considered as likely to cause a wrong?

There are two views you can take with respect to whether assuming somebody’s sex/sexuality offends another. The first is an objective view, whether or not the average person would be offended by somebody assuming their sex/sexuality. The second is a subjective one, whether or not the person you are talking to in particular would be offended. Since we are trying to argue the general case, we would be more inclined to take the objective view. Would the average person be offended by somebody assuming their sex/sexuality? The answer is probably no, however there is a key factor missing in this analysis. There exists the issue that that the people most likely to be affected or offended (ie those who do not fit into the binary heteronormative social construct) are in the minority, and so the “average person” is not actually representative of the affected class of people, which is the definition of marginalisation. 

I argue that you’ve arrived your view on the core assumption that guessing another’s gender or sexuality based on sexuality is NOT wrong because the average person, who most likely fits into the binary heteronormative construct. However, you failed to consider that your core assumption in fact marginalises the very group who is most likely to be wronged when you assume their gender/sexuality. 

Hence, it is not unreasonable to say that assuming another person’s gender/sexuality should be considered wrong."	1	1589993874.0	/r/changemyview/comments/gn26hs/cmv_im_not_wrong_to_assume_someone_sexsexuality/fr99gul/	1	"First some terminology

Even if they're trans you can usually tell that they're leaning to one side or another. You have to remember that some don't. 

I think the real problem is that the assumption is there. What is the purpose of that gender assumption? It's generally some level of relegation as to how you are going to treat them. Why? Gender shouldn't matter people say. Any sex can do whatever they want. 

So just don't start off with any gender: ""Excuse me, ma'am?"" (or sir). You could just use ""excuse me"". ""How are you doing today? "" is even easier to say than ""How are you doing today sir?"". It's easy enough to not bring gender into ANYTHING. Let them decide how they wish to be addressed. 

Also I know a guy (born male) who is straight but he's a cross-dresser. He's a sir all day long, definitely doesn't like it if you call him a girl. So if I don't know what someone is, I just take all gender/sex out of the equation until they tell me how it is. There is no actual purpose to labeling someone as a man or a woman, other than to label them and force them into some sort of pigeon hole. 

Just let people be people. Once they let you know, which honestly people generally let you know pretty quick, you can call them by their preferred pronouns/name/sex (if they have any of these).

Also, if you occasionally mess up their pronouns but you've asked or they have said and are trying to make sure that you're doing it right, they generally don't get pissed.

You make a good point here I didn't strongly consider in my reply to OP.

That said, sexuality is part of identity and ""don't ask, don't tell, don't assume"" has a lot of problems regarding shame.  When only about 10% of people have a trait, that's a distinguishing trait worth mentioning.  I don't think any person should ever hide or be offended about that.

I understand in a cold world of learning about friends you can ask ""hey, do you have a romantic partner or spouse?"", but nobody should be offended if you say ""hey, do you have a husband?"" and they're a straight male.  If someone asked me that, I'd just shrug and say ""no, I'm straight.  My wife and I have been together for X years..."" and that'd be it.  As you said, English is a gendered language.

And frankly, I've met people with very complex sexuality, and it's part of their identity enough to make it part of their personality.  I had a friend who was born female, identified as male, had no intention to get surgery... here's the rub.  He identified as a non-queer *gay* man (which means even though he would always have a woman's body, he was only interested in other gay men).  While he didn't yell that over the roof to everyone to hear, it was absolutely a part of his personality and knowing it helped you know him better."	1	1589979198.0	/r/changemyview/comments/gn26hs/cmv_im_not_wrong_to_assume_someone_sexsexuality/fr8hvd3/	1	"  But why would you need to assume someone s sexuality

But he's not doing that is he? He's assuming some is a woman based on any number of biological indicators that they are female. If less than 1% of the population is trans, then 99 times out of 100, he'll be correct.

The vast majority of women (when compared to men) are shorter, weaker, have higher pitched voices, no adam's apple, smaller frame, wider hips and breasts - if he's using these indicators to identify people, he's going to be correct 99 times out of 100 - even for some trans women who take hormones.

He's only ever going have a chance of being wrong when (a) he meets someone not identifying as their sex, or (b) they look completely different to the gender they identify as, or (c) they are gender-fluid and don't identify as any gender. All these combined are a less than 1% chance.

>it’s reinforcing norms and expectations.

Yes, because that's what it's like in reality - women are the way they are because of biology - even transgender women try to mimic these traits by taking hormones that enhance this norm.

If he was going around thinking that someone's a woman because they knit, or cook or clean, you'd have a point, but he's not, he's going by simple biological markers, which 99 times out of 100 will be absolutely accurate - even for some trans females.

You seem to want to live in a fantasy world where no-one looks like their own gender; everyone has to presume that a 6ft 4"" tall, broad shouldered, beard wearing, muscle bound, cigar smoking, dock worker, might identify as a woman, so you should have to verify their gender first - just so you're not ""reinforcing norms and expectations"" - WHY? 99% of the time they'll be correct and in the example I give above it's more likely to be 100% of the time.

This mindset is so fucked up -  you're in a little bubble and it's so far from reality it's shocking. The cognitive dissonance is so strong you've left reality in your own little spaceship and are orbiting around us in la la land.

I think possibly OP is perhaps trying to argue an implied ""*people shouldn't be upset at me* when I assume incorrectly"" which is a higher thresh-hold. But then again the wording in the post is pretty clear.

If /u/DnD_Nerd_765 is trying to argue the ""people shouldn't get upset at me for being wrong"" argument.. then I'd say:

1. I have assumed the wrong gender or wrong sexuality of dozens of people, and none of them have ever been upset. They correct me, I accept it, and we move on. There's a really common strawman argument about the angry misgendered person that really doesn't seem to exist in the real world.

My impression though is that OP is referring to more casual settings. Do you “need” to definitively know someone’s gender or sexuality in a social setting? It’s hard to argue that you do. However, someone’s gender or sexuality can still be relevant to you, even if you don’t *need* to know it.

This is where assumptions come in: without any other information, you assume that the person you find attractive shares a compatible sexual orientation with you, or you assume that a person presenting in a conventionally masculine or feminine manner is a man or woman respectively. Or maybe the person is presenting in a manner that sends mixed signals, in which case you should probably do them the favor of not making those assumptions.

The role of assumptions is to fill this gap between must know certainty and irrelevance.

Don’t get me wrong, I’ll call you whatever the hell pronouns you want to be called. I don’t care.

In my experience, it's real easy to avoid making assumptions by using people's names, they / them, and acknowledging other possibilities (e.g. do you have a boyfriend? girlfriend?) until people give you their labels. 

So far, I haven't had any one I've done this with say they were offended by it (most don't even notice).

CMV: I'm not wrong to assume someone sex/sexuality.		t5_2w2s8	"> Many cis-gendered people could be offended if I called them singular ""they"" by default. 

Sure, it's conceivable that someone could possibly be offended by a neutral pronoun. 

Personally, I  try to pay close attention to how people refer to themselves and follow their lead, rather than make assumptions. I would recommend just being mindful that multiple possibilities exist, and paying that tiny extra bit of attention to what that person seems to prefer when you are first meeting them. 

Given the degree of bullying, homophobia, etc. that many people have faced around their gender identity, at least this small degree of awareness / consideration from others seems warranted. 

In terms of gendered pronouns, an easy alternative is to just call people by their names, and refer to things as \[that person's name\]'s (rather than using gendered possessives). That approach should cover you in most situations, and leave things open enough when you're first meeting someone for them to let you know / observe if they want you to do something different.

Also, there are a lot of ways to convey openness and acceptance when interacting with people. I suspect that if your behavior conveys friendliness generally, someone is less likely to take a gender neutral pronoun as a slight.

CMV: I'm not wrong to assume someone sex/sexuality.		t5_2w2s8	But what does femininity look like? The constructs around what genders “should” look like are damaging too. Is a woman not feminine enough if she has short hair, is tall, has large muscles, chooses not to shave her legs/armpits/every inch of her body, wears pants, likes traditionally masculine things, acts assertively, etc. (I could go on forever). Is she not a woman? Is she “less than”? The criticism that women receive for being anything other than the picture of beautiful femininity is genuinely terrifying. And this expectation that members of any gender look/act/sound a certain way invites criticism for people who don’t fit the mold, and you are reinforcing gender constructs.

Shouldn't and ""don't"" are two different things.  That said, as a married person, my sexuality will always have some aspect central to who I am, if only indirectly based on the gender of the person I married........ Which is where sexuality is a huge deal and being outspoken is a big deal because before 2015, *gay marriage wasn't legal throughout the US*.  I knew people who were leaders in the gay rights movement who absolutely would open with ""I'm gay"" in the first 5 minutes with very good reason, because that struggle was one of the most important things in the world to them.

I knew these two wonderful people who were in the first wave of gay marriages in my state, having been together *decades* prior.  I don't understand how sexuality can't be a central part of their identity when they've dedicated their lives to that sexuality in many ways.

I'm trying to figure out why I believed only gay couples use partner and I suspect it's from growing up during a time when gay marriage was illegal.

If you assume people are straight, then you'll be correct a vast majority of the time, so it's more efficient to just assume people are straight and ask specifically about the straight spouse. The time and energy it takes to determine their sexuality, then ask about the proper gendered partner generally isn't worth the effort to go through with every single person you meet. If your assumption is wrong, then the other person will correct you and you can move on.

Most of them aren't constructs though - they are biologically driven. Sure I'll give you long hair, makeup and dresses - those are social constructs, but femininity - softer, higher pitched voice, smaller body, less muscle mass, breasts (of any size), less aggressive, less violent - these are all hormonally driven and not constructed at all.

The examples I give above indicate someone is feminine, because they are female traits, driven by female sex hormones. How exactly are they damaging? Women can't help being this way, that's how they're built. It's more damaging to try to say this isn't normal and it's only this way because society deems it so. You basically want to redefine what's normal because a minority of the population don't act or look a certain way - that's not how this works, at all.

>Is a woman not feminine enough if she has short hair, is tall, has large muscles, chooses not to shave her legs/armpits/every inch of her body, wears pants, likes traditionally masculine things, acts assertively, etc. (I could go on forever). Is she not a woman? Is she “less than”?

No she's not ""less than"" or not feminine enough and it's a completely different point to the one OP is making - he's not grading how feminine women are, he's simply identifying if they are male or female based on the biological characteristics of the vast majority of women - they will all conform (to a greater or lesser extent) to their biological sex, because in 99% of the population, their sex matches their gender; So, 99 times out of 100, he'll be correct in his assessment.

>The criticism that women receive for being anything other than the picture of beautiful femininity is genuinely terrifying.

I agree, although ""terrifying"" might be hyperbole on your part, but again this is veering off onto another subject that isn't entirely relevant to identifying the majority of the population. OP's not basing his identification of females on super feminine super-models, he's basing it on simple biological markers, which in the vast majority of cases, are going to be correct. There's no high standard to be met here, just some basic feminine biological traits.

>You absolutely can’t know someone’s sexuality from looking at them, and the stereotypes surrounding them are bullshit and equally damaging.

Agree and agree, but again, that's not what OP's saying - he's saying he's not going to presume you're anything other than the sexuality of the vast majority of the population - i.e. heterosexual. He's not identifying gay men if they act feminine or lesbians if they act masculine, because that would be morally wrong. He's just not basing it on anything other than, in the majority of cases, heterosexual is going to be correct - roughly 93% of the time.

CMV: I'm not wrong to assume someone sex/sexuality.		t5_2w2s8	"Yeah to add to this, there is a ton of gender neutral language you can use while you don't know for certain. After a bit of getting used to, it's actually very easy and feels natural, and the other party often doesn't even notice (whereas they might've noticed negatively otherwise).

Like, if they said ""My partner has recently started a new job"" you could answer ""Oh? What do they do?"" (or even ""Oh? What job?"" if you are really opposed to using singular they), most likely you'll be hit with a ""He/She does X"" and from then on, you can just use the pronouns the other person used.

English is kind of good for gender neutral language anyways, most nouns are ungendered and the gendered ones usually have an ungendered alternative like ""partner"" for ""boy/girlfriend"", ""sibling"" for ""sister/brother"", ""person"" for ""man/woman"", etc.

One thing to consider is really the impact on trans people when it comes to assuming gender. It's basically a big roulette. I definitely understand that it's just the way of doing things that we're used to and (providing you correct yourself and apologise in case you were wrong!) I don't think it means you're a bad person at all, but consider this:

If you gender a cis person correctly: 0 impact.
If you use ""they"" for a cis person: probably low to 0 impact.
If you accidentally misgender a cis person: It's rare that this happens, but it could potentially really hurt their self-confidence.

If you gender a trans person correctly: This can do anything from making their week to having near 0 impact, depending for example on how far they are into their transition.
If you use ""they"" for a trans person: This can be taken very positively but it could potentially also be taken negatively as some trans people who fully transitioned might be a bit iffy about someone suggesting that their gender isn't obvious. Also, it'd give many non-binary euphoria as well.
If you misgender a trans person: You might've ruined their day. Maybe even their week. Many would legit feel like shit because of this.

Sooo... It's really a big roulette. But you can't really go wrong using ""they"", reactions are most likely neutral with some very positive and some slightly negative ones.

I'd say it really helps trans people because it takes a lot of emotional intensity out of their lives.

Just something to consider.

Also, isn't it generally very difficult to assume a trans person's sex? They could be pre- or post-op and they'd look the same on the outside. So yeah by assuming everyone is cis, you'll be most likely correct. But if you had to guess the sex of just trans people, I'd assume you'd be quite lost. Then again, why does sex even matter?

Like  if they said  My partner has recently started a new job  you could answer  Oh  What do they do    or even  Oh  What job   if you are really opposed to using singular they   most likely you ll be hit with a  He She does X  and from then on  you can just use the pronouns the other person used 

English is kind of good for gender neutral language anyways  most nouns are ungendered and the gendered ones usually have an ungendered alternative like  partner  for  boy girlfriend    sibling  for  sister brother    person  for  man woman   etc 

One thing to consider is really the impact on trans people when it comes to assuming gender  It s basically a big roulette  I definitely understand that it s just the way of doing things that we re used to and  providing you correct yourself and apologise in case you were wrong   I don t think it means you re a bad person at all  but consider this

Not assuming gender and sexual orientation can come up any time you are meeting new people, like when you're making new friends, dating, meeting new people at work, etc. It comes up in the possibilities you mention when asking them questions, and how you refer to them in conversation. 

Honestly, you might already know people quite well who have a different gender identity or sexual orientation than you think ...

The thing is, many people won't correct you if you get it wrong. They might not want to make things awkward by calling attention to your mistake (like when someone mispronounces your name). And if someone has a stigmatized identity they have been bullied for, they might especially not want to call attention to it, because by assuming their gender / sexual orientation, it kinda implies that you aren't aware of / familiar with people like them, so they don't know how you will react to that info.

I use ""she/her"" but certainly don't mind being referred to as ""they"" if someone doesn't know how I identify. it's basically taking the neutral/middle route for everyone rather than just people with ambiguous gender presentation, because masculine and feminine presenting people may also be non-binary.

and yeah, sexuality isn't as pertinent. but again, for the sake of helping everyone feel comfortable and in honor of not making assumptions, words like partner or spouse are preferable until you know (and often even after you do know - many find ""bf/gf"" juvenile and prefer partner). people aren't likely to get offended per se if you get it wrong, but it can be kind of annoying to correct people all the time. it's just another reminder that you're outside of the norm as a queer person. when people start off with more neutral language, it takes a bit of the burden off of us which is nice and affirming to experience.

anyway, slipups are not a huge deal, just something that queer people have to expect and are usually pretty forgiving of. but imo the world is made just a little nicer when folks, especially cis/straight ones, make the effort to be inclusive.

If someone asks me if I'm dating anyone, I'm much more likely to mention that I'm bi than I am if they ask me if I have a boyfriend. If someone casually uses gender-neutral language, it's a hint that they've considered the fact that the people around them might not be straight/cis and they're chill about it. And even if I don't tell you I'm bi right then, I'll probably feel safer around you.	1	1589992268.0	/r/changemyview/comments/gn26hs/cmv_im_not_wrong_to_assume_someone_sexsexuality/fr961ta/	2	Another potentially good thing about using gender neutral language  I often feel way more comfortable coming out  I m bi  to people who use gender neutral language  If someone asks me if I m dating anyone  I m much more likely to mention that I m bi than I am if they ask me if I have a boyfriend  If someone casually uses gender neutral language  it s a hint that they ve considered the fact that the people around them might not be straight cis and they re chill about it  And even if I don t tell you I m bi right then  I ll probably feel safer around you

I'd almost argue that these two fall together a bit, because if something is a genuine part of your identity you want to show off, then the way you act will reflect that. Like if being masculine is important to your identity, you'll act in a masculine way and will, at least to a degree, be read like that.

Also, just because someone asks doesn't mean they initially read you differently, they might get straight vibes from you but they always ask everyone about their sexuality because they know you can't really assume from looks.

Well it depends -- *why* would the non-notable person be treated this way? The actual notable's person notoriety explains a non-malicious reason as to the attention, so yes once you remove the non-malicious explanation for the attention, naturally the attention seems strange. 

But if there's a non-malicious reason, some of those behaviors could make sense. Private citizens are photographed in public places when they're being followed by a private investigator for a divorce proceeding, for example, and the investigator doesn't get a protective order.

In most states you have to show more than unwanted contact to get a protective/restraining order, you have to show reasonable chance of danger. The same standard *does* apply for celebrities; if a paparazzi's attention creates a reasonable apprehension of danger they *can already* get the restraining order. Celebrities do in fact get restraining orders against crazed fans and whatnot all the time.

Here's an article about Ariana Grande getting a restraining order against a fan: https://www.stltoday.com/people/ariana-grande-seeks-restraining-order-against-fan/article_4d329eb2-526d-5e4d-8c55-d5a48771d3f5.html

You got your commercial grade 320-grit sandpaper that seems good at making your buttcrack raw while practically capturing nothing, lots of stuff above that grade, up to the personal best I had used which I believe was made by Scott. Instead of fun flowery patterns on it, it's just a series of rather decent ridges, in my personal experience it had some decent cleaning power.

On point 2.... Cost would be one. Let's forego the actual installing a standalone bidet in every home, since construction costs alone for every home without the room for it already would make it a huge drawback. They have toilets with built in bidets, or aftermarket bidet add-on kits for existing toilets. While saving a lot of money over standalones, there still is a cost involved. I'm sure you've thought of that.

But what about the increased water usage? Having cheap water available aplenty as it is already invites people to go building big pools in their backyard etc. Imagine if after every poop another 1/4 or 1/2 gallon of clean water was used. How would this tax the water supply system? How would this affect the availability of clean water, a resource we are encouraged to preserve when possible? Will this open the door to other forced upgrade mandates on homes, will every home have to gut their wiring and have it done to the latest NEC standards, will every home be mandated to install a 90+ efficient furnace?

And mansplaining is not sexist humor. It's a very real phenomenon that many women have experienced, particularly those of us who find ourselves in male dominated professions and hobbies. 

It is a type of condescension, but it's a very distinct type, in which men assume they're more knowledgeable about something than a woman solely by virtue of their respective genders. 

One trend I've noticed that demonstrates this is that, in work environments, it's almost always the least knowledgeable and least experienced men who mansplain things to me, and a lot of the time, their explanations are wrong. I've talked to many male coworkers about it, and the mansplainers have never done that to them. So at least some of them must have known they didn't understand what they were talking about, but they casually assumed that I wouldn't realize that. 

Could it be something other than gender that made them think that? Maybe I just seemed particularly stupid or incompetent to them for some other reason? Sure, and I have considered that quite a bit, and it's made me doubt myself quite a bit too. But I heard the same thing from other women I worked with, and then I saw other women on the internet saying it happened to them, too. 

Again, it can be misapplied and misunderstood. I've been accused of mansplaining twice, but that was because the people accusing me misunderstood the concept, and in both cases, the people accusing me didn't know that the things I was explaining were my areas of expertise.

A lot of behavior is subconsciously driven, hard to control, and modeled by examples one has witnessed through development (father interacting with mother, male adult figures interacting with other women, etc.).

2: I have seen too much evidence to prove to me beyond a reasonable doubt that 1 is true. I have witnessed people doing it to my mother, who is intelligent, owns her own business, and is in most ways far above average. I have witnessed it in other points in my life, and I sometimes wonder if even I have done it. Have you seen AskReddit threads with countless male AND female testimonies about how women are treated differently than men? Whether it's in customer support, at a car dealership, a plumber, etc. A condescending answer or a blatantly rude dismissal is given to a woman, but once her husband comes into the picture, the other person's attitude changes completely. Another example is a TedX talk of a 50 something year old male-to-female transgender woman who knew she finally passed as a woman, because men would start giving her condescending attitude in places that never happened in her past 50 years of life. Sexism is just rampant in western society, and I can understand why so many people are outraged at even the suggestion that it exists. It's hard to notice, and I don't think many are ready to handle changing their ways.

3: Now, just because that's a real phenomenon, it does not mean that there isn't sexism against men. It does not mean that there aren't equivalent cases in the reverse. Also, people are not perfect judges of social situations. Social situations can be inherently ambiguous, so it is completely possible for an accuser to cry ""mainsplaining"" and be mistaken. I am sure this has also happened to me.

So with 1, 2, and 3 in mind, I would argue that a real phenomenon can have a vocabulary word attached to it. Even if people misuse it, even in a hypocritical way, I don't think that invalidates the term. Therefore, I disagree that ""mansplaining"" is a sexist term.

Additionally: This type of questioning happens with ""racism"". You can never truly know what is going on inside another person's head. But do you think sometimes people might get the sense that they are being treated with racism, and it is right to call it out? Of course, the accused can just say, ""you think I'm being racist just because I'm \_insert race here\_?"" Again, these situations can be ambiguous, so undoubtedly, there will be false alarms.

"CMV: ""Mansplaining"" is a sexist term"		t5_2w2s8	"I agree, but I understand where the term comes from. 

I believe it originates in instances such as this example:

A woman is doing some rudimentary task such as checking her car's oil or trying to position an image in Microsoft word.
A man approaches her without being asked to and either offers to do it for her, or says something like: 
""Look sweetheart, you take it like this and blah blah blah. See? Now it's fixed.""

In this scenario, the man is sexist because he assumed she was incapable, was uninvited, and explained condescendingly.

However, I do believe this term's definition has been broadened to include situations where the man is not at fault.

Such as:
A man and a woman are having a casual conversation. The topic of history comes up and the man relates a piece of his historical knowledge he thinks she might enjoy, in a non-condescending tone. She cuts him off however, saying he's mansplaining, and she is in fact doing her master's thesis on that very subject.

In this scenario, the woman is to blame because she interpreted the definition of the term too widely. The man did not know she was well-learned in the subject, and he didn't assume she couldn't possibly know it because she is a woman.  He simply wanted to add to conversation. Anyone not possessing telepathic powers wouldn't have known she was an expert.

A better reaction would be for her to say ""that's right"" or ""you're close"" or ""that's not quite right"" and then politely tell him she's a grad student, and then she can tell him/explain to him what she finds interesting about the topic.

In conclusion, the term originally described a very real and sexist social phenomenon amongst some males, but now its definition has been broadened to include cases of miscommunication that everyone is susceptible to, but can be quite vexing for the one listening to the explanation.

Therefore the term, in my opinion, should be changed to ""over-explaining"" or something similar, because constraining a word to it's original definition is nearly impossible.

Mansplaining shouts down women who have equal or greater expertise in a subject while, often while delivering incorrect information on that subject.  

Patronizing and condescending behavior often claims credit for a woman’s suggestion, usually in her words in the same meeting after calling her some variation on cute or just outright ignoring that she spoke in the first place.

There is some overlap, but mansplaining has the implication that the woman has more reason to know what she’s talking about than the man does.  It’s very common in academia.

It’s asking an expert who is a woman for her take on something she’s an expert in and telling her she’s wrong.  Then offering a less well researched opinion based on a google search.

"CMV: ""Mansplaining"" is a sexist term"		t5_2w2s8	"Is there a reason that you think mansplaining is a sexist term other than it referring to a specific gender?
There can be some confusion around what mansplaining means, so to clarify, the usage of mansplaining that I'm familiar is ""a man assuming a woman doesn't know what she's doing because she's a woman, and therefore trying to correct her/give her unwanted advice about something she already knows"". The essential part of that sentence is that the only reason the guy is explaining said thing, is because he assumes the woman doesn't know what she is talking about. Thus the name ""mansplaining"".  This is a phenomenon that many females have faced, especially in the workforce, or if they are in to more stereotypically male hobbies. It has even caused some women's medical problems to be ignored, because male doctors and gynecologists would not believe women actually knew what was happening in their own bodies. Is it sexist for women to come up with a term to describe their experiences?
On the other hand, what about ""femsplaining""? Is there a phenomenon of women assuming men don't know things, and explaining them to men? It's possible. I think in a lot of areas of knowledge, it is assumed that men are the ones that know better than women what's what so ""femsplaining"" wouldn't be that relevant in those areas. However, there are certain things like parenting or cooking perhaps where a woman is going to be stereotypically perceived as having more knowledge than a man. I would not consider it sexist to call a woman out on ""femsplaining"" if she is for instance, trying to give a father parenting tips that he did not ask for. I am not a man, so I don't know, but I would be interested in hearing if men have ever been ""femsplained"" about something like that.

when there is an -ist added to a word, especially one focusing on personal identity, it is not just a reference to an ""ignorant"" act... it replies that there is a form of systematic oppression happening. systematic is the crucial word (there is no doubt that people say intolerant things that can offend men as well as women) since it implies that this is not a one-off thing but rather engraved into our society through our institutions and collective consciousness.

so, labels such as racist, sexist, ableist, classist, etc., are referring to the systematic oppression of the unrepresented, ignored and persecuted populations: such as people of color, women, homosexuals, immigrants etc.

"CMV: ""Mansplaining"" is a sexist term"		t5_2w2s8	"\> I think that pretending that sexism against men doesn't exist contributes to sexism. 

I'm going to focus my argument on your conflation of sexism and prejudice. It's a common problem, if prejudice against women is bad then it's only fair that prejudice against men is bad too. Sure, I get it. It's not fun to be discriminated against. The problem is that prejudice against men and women are not the same because the context is not the same.

&#x200B;

The reality is that there is systemic inequality in our world. Women aren't just hurt by the prejudicial opinions/actions of men, they're also hurt by structures built by and for men. We have to understand prejudice in light of this systemic inequality if we're going to build more just systems.  


Prejudice against women operates under the same logic as our unjust systems that prioritize men. It serves to reinforce stereotypes that support the systems that concentrate power in the hands of men at the expense of women. A clear example is the double-bind that women in leadership experience:  [https://www.npr.org/2018/03/05/590881966/-shes-shrill-but-hes-just-being-a-boss-the-double-bind-for-women-in-leadership](https://www.npr.org/2018/03/05/590881966/-shes-shrill-but-hes-just-being-a-boss-the-double-bind-for-women-in-leadership) 

That's prejudice reinforcing systems that already advantage men.

&#x200B;

Men don't get that double-bind. Prejudice against men might suck, but it doesn't come along with structural inequality our expense. To call prejudice against men sexism, as if it's just the same as what women experience does a disservice because it hides the reality of structural inequality. It doesn't acknowledge the broader context that informs and is informed by said prejudice.  


And heck, while I'm at it. I don't think that the term mansplaining necessarily references the mansplainers intentions. All it does is point out that the behavior fits a broader pattern."	1	1589998546.0	/r/changemyview/comments/gncwwe/cmv_mansplaining_is_a_sexist_term/fr9j9td/	2	"   I think that pretending that sexism against men doesn t exist contributes to sexism

"CMV: ""Mansplaining"" is a sexist term"		t5_2w2s8	"My point was to separate ""This is a sexist term"" from ""This term can be used in a sexist way."" For instance, I don't think you would consider ""sexist"" itself a sexist term. However, you can absolutely call somebody sexist because you assume they are engaging in discriminatory behavior because of their gender; e.g. a dude calling his boss sexist because he assumes women only promote other women would be using ""sexist"" in a sexist way.

The issue in your example is not with the term, it is with the *unjustified* act of cutting somebody off, silencing them, or ignoring them. It would be just as much of a problem if they cut the man off by calling him a condescending know-nothing; a lot if he was being genuinely helpful, and not at all if he was being a condescending know-nothing. This also loops back to the term ""mansplaining"" itself, because it's a term to describe just how often women are cut off, silenced, or ignored due to sexism; your concern about men being silenced by the term is exactly the issue women *already* face. I think it's fair to agree that being cut off because of ""mansplaining"" happens a lot more often than people being cut off by being called ""mansplainers."""	1	1589989928.0	/r/changemyview/comments/gncwwe/cmv_mansplaining_is_a_sexist_term/fr918br/	3	"My point was to separate  This is a sexist term  from  This term can be used in a sexist way   For instance  I don t think you would consider  sexist  itself a sexist term  However  you can absolutely call somebody sexist because you assume they are engaging in discriminatory behavior because of their gender  e g  a dude calling his boss sexist because he assumes women only promote other women would be using  sexist  in a sexist way

"CMV: ""Mansplaining"" is a sexist term"		t5_2w2s8	"As a man, it doesn’t seem to me that silencing a man entirely or completely ignoring his point is an inherent quality or goal of the term “mansplaining”. Certainly there will be some who misuse it that way, but that’s not really what the term represents and I’m not sure I’d agree that it’s used that way most often. 

In our society it is quite common for men to talk down to women about something, despite the men having equal or lesser knowledge. I generally think of myself as someone who respects women and even I have caught myself doing it once or twice. I think you may be underestimating how often it happens. Sure, anyone can condescend to anyone else, but this is a very specific and relatively common occurrence. 

I don’t doubt that some people use the term just to silence men, but I don’t think it can be said that our society generally silences men. It’s the opposite in fact, men tend to dominate the discourse on just about every issue. 

I think it’s analogous to the term “racism”. There are people who throw the term around a lot and call everyone that disagrees with them a racist in an effort to discredit them. In the grand scheme of things, probably not that many, but it definitely happens. That said, it’s still a very real issue that plays a major role in our society and I don’t really think that it’s just a tool to silence white people. 

Ultimately I think it’s about scale. Millions of women have things mansplained to them every day regardless of their intelligence or qualifications. How many men have legitimate discussion points completely shut down because they’re accused of mansplaining? Obviously there’s no hard data, but do you really think the two will be close? 

Anecdotal, but I think I’ve been unfairly accused of mansplaining maybe once? But I think most educated women could list half a dozen instances of it being done to them in the last month. At least, that’s the sense I get from personal experience and talking to the women in my life.

However, that does not mean that ""white supremacy"" is an inherently racist term, or that its usage implies only white people can be racial supremacists.

I don't see that as a doublebind, even though I think men are harmed by patriarchy because of the ways toxic masculinity is prized.

With regards to ""momsplaining"" and fatherhood, I don't think men are in a doublebind so much as a win-win. Men aren't expected to be caring for the kids or managing the home in the same way women are. They don't carry the same mental load as women do (link below). They're generally not penalized for carrying their weight at home, and they're often valorized for doing the same work expected from women. Momsplaining comes from the expectation that men aren't expected to do the basic work of managing the house, and it's that same expectation of ineptitude that furthers the expectation that men be out of the house and be freed the expectation of doing the work of parenting/managing the household.

So yeah, it sucks to be a single-dad and have things ""momsplained"". It's always shitty to condescendingly explain things to someone because you presume they don't/won't know it. But that expectation comes from systems that privilege men at the expense of women. It's rooted in the expectation that men need not do the work and that women must. If it's sexist it's not sexist against men, it's sexism against women biting men in the ass.

"CMV: ""Mansplaining"" is a sexist term"		t5_2w2s8	">I disagree. I think you can be sexist toward men. Consider the following two examples

I'm not sure how your first example addresses my point about the broader context of systemic inequality. I'm not arguing that we shouldn't call out prejudicial acts against the members of the dominant group as hateful. But to equate sexism and prejudice against men is make the context of systemic inequality invisible. It doesn't take in to account the way that sexist statement contribute to the framework of injustice at work in our world in ways that prejudice against men (while still hateful and wrong) don't.

With regards to your second point, I have indeed heard that courts favor women with regards to custody of children. I don't want to deny that men are hurt by patriarchy and sexism, but that sexism still needs to be understood in the context of systems that are set up to benefit men. In reference to custody disputes, I'd argue that this is product of archaic notions that women are meant to be raising children. It's tied to expectations that women are mothers. It's tied to the crappy realities of women in the work place. It's tied to the ways we've freed men from the expectation of pulling their fair share in the home.

You can't separate the sexist aspect of a term when it has `man` in it. Doubly so when the definition of the term makes is applicable only to men. 

'womansplaining' and 'mansplaining' are inherently sexist in both their etymology and definition, and no amount of mental gymnastics will change that.

The neutral form is 'patronising', 'condescending', 'talking down to'. If you're choosing '<gender>splaining' over those, you're deliberately choosing to inject gender into a concept that doesn't require it. That's sexist by definition. QED.

>* Congressmen’s Condescension of Sally Yates
Colin Jones on Twitter

>    * During her testimony on Monday, former acting Attorney General Sally Yates swatted down some particularly patronizing questions from Republican congresspersons. During Ted Cruz’s interrogation of Yates, his attempts to impugn her judgement of the travel ban by criticizing her presumed inability to identify a specific section of the law by name did not go over well. Twitter was especially into Yates’ responses throughout her testimony, with one user noting that she “has the face of a woman who has had to patiently explain things to men way too many times.”

Here one not only with mansplaining, but whitesplaning as well:

>* Matt Damon Explaining Diversity to Effie Brown
Glen Coco on Twitter

>    * During an episode of the series Project Greenlight, a show in which established industry professionals seek aspiring filmmakers for a project, Matt Damon tried to explain diversity to Effie Brown, a producer who’s worked on projects like Dear White People and who is black and female. When Brown expressed concerns about their film project’s potential race and gender problems, suggesting a more racially and gender diverse team would be better suited for the project, Damon responded with this: “When we’re talking about diversity, you do it in the casting of the film, not in the casting of the show.”  **The privileged explaining here is two-fold, exemplifying both mansplaining and whitesplaining. Damon, who is a male and white, asserts he knows best when it comes to how to handle racial and gender diversity, despite opposition from Brown, the only woman color in the room and the only person who’s likely experienced racism and sexism first hand.**

Or, here's another example:

>* Former Rep. Todd Akin Saying There Is Such a Thing as “Legitimate Rape”
Giphy

>    * In a conversation about abortion rights which occurred in 2012, then-Missouri Rep. Todd Akin said a woman cannot get pregnant in cases of “legitimate rape.” While he retracted the comment, you simply cannot unring the “legitimate rape” bell. **Men explaining women’s bodies to them is a tale as old as time but one that still persists this day.** For example, a cisgender man recently tried to explain to me, a human woman who menstruates, what Midol is. Yes, that Midol.

Specifically it calls out bias some men have shown.  There are males whom try to explain to a woman how their bodies work.  When these women have a higher level of experience with their bodies than the men trying to explain.  Or, take a male engineer speaking to a female engineer who is more experienced in what they are talking about.  But the male engineer explains how X works from the ground up because he assumes she doesn't know the basics due to being a woman.  

Men looking down on a woman's ability to understand things, especially technical ones, is common.  It's waaay less common today than any other time.  But it still occurs.  This label just allows us to point it out and deal with it.  It's especially useful when the man is open and willing to accept to the critique.

Basically, it is condescending and/or patronizing with a dash of misogynistic attitudes\tones\bias.  So it's more than just condescending and/or patronizing.

Okay so we agree... I guess? That argument is very poorly written at that point though.

When these women have a higher level of experience with their bodies than the men trying to explain.

But the male engineer explains how X works from the ground up because he assumes she doesn't know the basics due to being a woman.

So you're essentially talking about stupid people who are acting in a condescending manner towards people who are smarter than they are. I still fail to see the need to gender the term relating to that kind of behaviour. I'm sure you could find this exact kind of behaviour in nursing or some field like that.

CMV: The recently dismissed discrimination lawsuit by the U.S. Women's Soccer team and the circus surrounding it is strong evidence of ideological bias in the media.		t5_2w2s8	"I'm trying to find out exactly why you think that CNN article is objectionable?  

You may think the lawsuit itself is objectionable, and apparently so does the judge on many of the claims.  But CNN's report is quite accurate as to what the parties to the lawsuit said and what the judge ruled.

The first sentence says the court rejected the idea they were paid less.  Maybe the phrasing is a little awkward so some readers might not get it from that sentence, but ""awkward phrasing"" isn't evidence of ideological bias, just awkward phrasing.

The article begins by saying the judge rejected the claims they were paid less, and will allow claims about unequal treatment in travel/hotel to proceed.  This is all accurate if mildly boring.  The next paragraph describes what was going on in the case procedurally.  Boring perhaps, but also good journalism to help the reader understand how the court case works.

Then the article quotes the claims made in the lawsuit, and then explains that the judge rejected those claims and spends a good bit of time quoting the judge's ruling.

This is overall a fairly boring and prosaic article explaining a court ruling, which accurately describes the claims brought in the lawsuit, and how the court ruled on them.

The only concrete evidence you cited for that proposition was a single CNN article which you now agree is not bad and which fairly explains the ruling and context. 

You make characterizations about how other media outlets portrayed the suit, but you don't specify which outlets or link to objectionable articles.  Looking back to when the suit was filed, I found [this New York Times piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/sports/womens-soccer-team-lawsuit-gender-discrimination.html) which describes the compensation scheme in some detail, though it does spend a lot more time discussing the claims in the lawsuit, perhaps because as it notes, the defendant US Soccer didn't comment to the NYT and therefore there was nobody to rebut the women's team's claims.

So I would ask, what is your ""strong evidence of ideological bias in the media?""

Edit to add: I think as well the fact that US Soccer wasn't commenting to reporters when the suit was filed badly hurt their PR campaign.  If the women suing are able to give lots of quotes and have their lawyers walk the reporter through their claims, and US Soccer just gives a ""no comment"" that's going to make bad PR.

"CMV: There's no such a thing as ""Blackface"" or even ""Social Appropriation""."		t5_2w2s8	"It's mostly about the way the cultural interaction goes. Take Star Wars, for instance. It was highly influenced by Akira Kurosawa, who in his turn was highly influenced by Shakespeare. In those cases, you have artists respecting each other (well Shakes is long dead but you know what I mean) and taking each other's culture seriously, and adopting ideas unironically.  
Comparatively, if you have a person dress up in a traditional costume of some other culture for a party or an event, they aren't really interested in reciprocal exchange or taking it seriously. That is to say, they don't really see it as culture to be respected but as a novelty outside of culture. They wouldn't seriously consider adopting it in a unironic way by wearing it in a non-novelty context.  

For the draids example, it could go both ways. You could have white people genuinely picking that hairstyle because they like it, and others who pick it because it's a novelty and it's ""what black people do"". In the latter case, the hairstyle is not adopted for its own sake but as part of a broader desire for novelty.  

Of course, the notion of cultural appropriation can go too far. I personally tend to shy away from most SJW notions since it can turn irrational really fast.. But at the root of it, there is the idea of mutual respect and taking culture seriously as opposed to an ironic appreciation, and even the least SJW people are instinctively receptive to the difference.

Of course  the notion of cultural appropriation can go too far  I personally tend to shy away from most SJW notions since it can turn irrational really fast   But at the root of it  there is the idea of mutual respect and taking culture seriously as opposed to an ironic appreciation  and even the least SJW people are instinctively receptive to the difference  Imagine what a far right Japanese politician might think if he sees a neckbeard telling him he studied the power of nippon steel and the smoothness of the katana "

Maybe I misunderstood you, but if certain ethnic hairstyles are not being accepted, is that discrimination actually acceptable? If braids or dreads aren't accepted, then a larger percentage of people of a certain background will have access to a smaller job pool. Jobs are not infinite, and neither is the amount of time and effort you have to keep applying to more jobs when you get turned down. If people of a certain background have to deal with this obstacle, they shouldn't have to just suck it up and deal with it and move on. This is exactly the type of systemic racism that certain cities have already begun dealing with, for example, by outlawing discrimination against ethnic hairstyles.

Should Samoan people have to spend extra effort looking for jobs because companies don't allow tattoos? Even if those people have to spend extra effort to prepare for work, by unnaturally straightening hair, or wearing extra clothes to cover up tattoos, that is still an unfair disadvantage or annoyance in life for those people.

The reasons that you stated for rejecting an actor might apply to an individual black actor, but surely they can't apply to all black actors all the time. Only hiring the best white actors ever for all roles would easily lead to a very segregated industry that only has white actors.  One of the major critisms that hollywood has faced and even continues to face is a lack of diverse role models that diverse individuals can look up to. Does painting a white actor black actually solve the problem of a black child having no one in popular media to relate to or connect to or see as a positive role model for their race? I am not saying that black children must use black actors as role models or heroes, but I am saying that they should be able to have that choice as an option.

This is somewhat of a vicious cycle because there’s an argument of ‘you can’t get a job without a degree’ but it floods the market with degrees meaning the next round of people need degrees to keep up. Some of these people decide to travel the world before getting full time employment. They decide to own and run a car that they can’t actually afford. So for some people, they put themselves in a bad starting point because they think of now instead of the future. 

Also, when it comes to employment, there are a lot of people who try and ‘do what they want to do’. Sure if you can get a job doing what you want to do, it makes your work life better but especially since more people get into further education and study a particular topic, I find there is more of a focus on a person doing what they want instead of accepting that you may just need to take A job doing something else, either temporary or long term.

This is somewhat of a vicious cycle because there’s an argument of ‘you can’t get a job without a degree’ but it floods the market with degrees meaning the next round of people need degrees to keep up. Some of these people decide to travel the world before getting full time employment. They decide to own and run a car that they can’t actually afford.
