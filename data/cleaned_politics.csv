Discussion Thread: White House Press Briefing – 05/20/2020 | Live - 3:00pm EDT		t5_2cneq	"Well I'm late, but I'll just sum this up because I've got nothing better to do. Here are the ""highlights"" for today:

* McEnany opened by praising Trump for fulfilling his promises to bring back American manufacturing jobs (in relation to PPE), rebuking Obama's comment that you'd need a ""magic wand"" to bring them back. She did not give any job numbers to back this up.

* Every time McEnany was asked about what made pushes for mass mail-in ballots illegal, as Trump claimed in a tweet, she said to direct questions regarding that to the Trump *campaign*, her former employer.

* When a CNN reporter asked about why Trump doesn't support mass mail-in voting, McEnany said there has to be a ""reason"" for doing it. When the same reporter said the virus was a good reason to have it, McEnany snarked ""I'm glad you have the prediction tool to know what will be happening November 3rd"". When the reporter brought up primaries coming up soon, McEnany deferred to the Trump campaign again.

* When a reporter asked about Trump's claim that ""thousands of people"" on the front line of combating the virus are taking hydroxycloroquin, this launched McEnany into a list of prepared statements, including defending the original use of the drug, listing talk show hosts who mocked Trump for claiming he was using it (Jimmy Kimmel, Jow Scarborough, and Chris Cuomo), bringing up that Chris Cuomo used a more ""unsafe"" version of the drug, and quoting NY Governor *Andrew* Cuomo about his hopes for the drug (that were made before revelations about it).

* McEnany defended Trump's complaint about Michigan's mail-in voting by saying it was directed at the Office of Management and Budget, rather than his base. When a reporter asked why Trump would voice that complaint in the form of a tweet instead of a statement, that doesn't mention the OMB, McEnany said it was a sign of ""unprecedented transparency"" in the Trump presidency.

* Regarding Trump's comment that the high number of cases was a ""badge of honor"" for the country, McEnany clarified that it was an indication of how many tests the country has that there were so many known positive cases.

* When a reporter quoted Eric Trump saying that the coronavirus will ""magically go away"" after the election, implying it's being exacerbated by the Democrats, McEnany said she hoped Trump and his family wouldn't be taken out of context (despite being a direct quote) and that ""we should all hope the coronavirus goes away"", seemingly ignoring the context of Eric's quote herself.

* When asked about Michigan Governor Whitmer asking why she wasn't invited to an event with the president in her state, McEnany listed the money and resources her state was given, saying ""the governor is concerned about an invitation when she should be thanking the president""

* When asked about an op-ed from Susan Rice about Trump's response to the virus, McEnany briefly summed up a timeline of Trump's response to the virus (glossing over the month of February) before focusing on an email Rice sent herself about the Flynn investigation and criticized her career. She then said ""Thank you for bringing up Susan Rice, not in the context that I wished, but thank you"" before leaving."	1	1590012886.0	/r/politics/comments/gnh86a/discussion_thread_white_house_press_briefing/fra7z27/	7	"Well I m late  but I ll just sum this up because I ve got nothing better to do  Here are the  highlights  for today

February 12, 2016 

> Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), co-chairs of the bipartisan Senate Ukraine Caucus, and Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on European Affairs spearheaded a letter expressing concern to Ukrainian President Poroshenko regarding the recent resignation of Minister of Economy Aivaras Abromavi?ius, who has alleged that corruption remains a dire challenge within the Ukrainian political system. In the letter, Portman, Durbin, and Shaheen said they recognized the challenges facing the Ukrainian government two years after the Maidan brought positive change to Ukraine.  They also reaffirmed their commitment to help President Poroshenko confront the duel threat posed by Russian aggression in Ukraine as well as entrenched corruption in the government and to create a transparent and democratic government. The letter was also signed by Senators **Ron Johnson (R-WI)**, Chris Murphy (D-CT), Mark Kirk (R-IL), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and Sherrod Brown (D-OH).

> “We recognize ‎that your governing coalition faces not only endemic corruption left from decades of mismanagement and cronyism, but also an illegal armed seizure of territory by Russia and its proxies,” the senators wrote. “Tackling such obstacles to reforms amidst a war and the loss of much of southeastern Ukraine’s economic productivity is a formidable challenge -- one which we remain committed to helping you overcome.”

> Full text of the letter can be found below.

>> Dear President Poroshenko,

>> As members of the U.S. Senate Ukraine Caucus and strong supporters of your government, we write to express our concern regarding the recent resignation of Minister of Economy Aivaras Abromavi?ius‎ and his allegations of persistent corruption in the Ukrainian political system.

>> During the past year, Mr. Abromavi?ius and his team implemented tough but necessary economic reforms, worked to combat endemic corruption, and promoted more openness and transparency in government. He was known to many of us as a respected reformer and supporter of the Ukrainian cause. Minister Abromavi?ius‎’s allegations raise concerns about the enormous challenges that remain in your efforts to reform the corrupt system you inherited.

>> We recognize ‎that your governing coalition faces not only endemic corruption left from decades of mismanagement and cronyism, but also an illegal armed seizure of territory by Russia and its proxies. Tackling such obstacles to reforms amidst a war and the loss of much of southeastern Ukraine’s economic productivity is a formidable challenge -- one which we remain committed to helping you overcome.

>> Succeeding in these reforms will show Russian President Vladimir Putin that an independent, transparent, and democratic Ukraine can and will succeed. It also offers a stark alternative to the authoritarianism and oligarchic cronyism prevalent in Russia. As such, we respectfully ask that you address the serious concerns raised by Minister Abromavi?ius‎. We similarly urge you to press ahead with urgent reforms to the Prosecutor General's office and judiciary. The unanimous adoption by the Cabinet of Ministers of the Basic Principles and Action Plan is a good step.

Since coronavirus started, it would be great if there were a state rule that didn't allow daycares to charge us partial tuition for us hard working Virginian's --- especially when they shut down during the coronavirus or stayed open only for first responders.  Parents were then put in a bind - pay to retain a spot on the daycare roster and don't send your kid (meaning you're essentially paying for the opportunity for future service) or send your kid but increase your exposure --- especially if the only other parents using daycare are first responders, e.g. those that have a much higher exposure to the coronavirus.  Just seems like something worth looking into.

I first heard about you during the gun thing. I was so happy someone from our side was actually not taking their shit anymore. I am in the 72nd /9th Senate and for the first time in forever, I can say all of my representatives are great. Just need to vote the screwhead in chief out.   


I think it is great that we could all work together to get rid of the TRAP laws this year. I volunteer at a clinic in Richmond (you should stop by some Saturday morning next session) but I have had to curtail due to social distancing. But clients going into the clinics face harassment disguised as ""counseling""  that borders on terrorism. We have been lucky but I am pretty sure that the craziness with the other protests is going to be reflected at the clinics once the state reopens fully. Is there something that could be done statewide to provide either buffer zones or just something to back up local law enforcement so clients can obtain a medical procedure without having people in their face all of the time?

I think it is great that we could all work together to get rid of the TRAP laws this year  I volunteer at a clinic in Richmond  you should stop by some Saturday morning next session  but I have had to curtail due to social distancing  But clients going into the clinics face harassment disguised as  counseling   that borders on terrorism  We have been lucky but I am pretty sure that the craziness with the other protests is going to be reflected at the clinics once the state reopens fully  Is there something that could be done statewide to provide either buffer zones or just something to back up local law enforcement so clients can obtain a medical procedure without having people in their face all of the time  I think the police actually know that some of the protestors routinely break the law but don t want to deal with the churches crying to the media about it

But for folks that are genuinely curious, I usually explain it by saying that capitalism isn't just markets.  It's the system where the rich own all the businesses and make all the decisions, while the rest of us work to make them richer.

Socialism, on the other hand, is a system where the people who do the work actually own their workplaces and make all the decisions in them.  Because when the workers are the ones making the decisions, there are certain things they'll just never do.  They won't outsource their own jobs to increase a profit margin.  They won't poison their own community because they're the ones breathing that air and drinking that water.

The Virginia General Assembly has historically been almost entirely doctors, lawyers, realtors, and large farm owners.

Every legislative body has a team of attorneys on staff to help make sure that the intent of the legislators is correctly translated into legal-ese, and beyond that it's up to the voters to decide whether or not the individual candidate has a firm grasp on the actual issues that matter in the race.

Socialism is about direct worker ownership over the means of production and an economic system which opposes profit being the main incentive for society.

In our current system there are two viable candidates for president. The one that is closer to progressive values is Biden.

Voting is a powerful tool because it decides who will be put in a position to enact policy. Because our current system provides two viable candidates in a presidential election, voting should be viewed through the prism of which of the two is more closely aligned to your preferred policies.

While there are some generally accurate tells, the most reliable tell is when someone says or does that's distinctly out of the ordinary for their behavior.

She's set a very clear and consistent behavior of checking her binder full of answers to cover a wide variety of questions. It's clear she's just an emotionless robot designed to spew Trump's bullshit. Whenever she's asked a question the first thing she does is flip to the page of talking points because she never has to actually think on her feet. On one hand you could argue that's being prepared. Another angle it comes off as inauthentic and highlighting that she doesn't actually know any of the talking points until she reads them.

When she was asked what specifically was illegal she didn't have an answer. She didn't have a talking point. Because there isn't one.

She deflected which was a very common feature of Sarah Sanders. She was deflection incarnate. Kayleigh has otherwise been the opposite -- straight up has the talking point. Except not for this.

Trump doesn't have an answer for this because it's bogus. Sensible people know it's a bogus claim that it's illegal to have mail in ballots. There's not even a faint indication of a talking point, and that's all driven by how Kayleigh reacts to a question being asked.

A key piece of their immunity argument is that you can't be investigated WHILE PRESIDENT. So when you leave the office, you can be investigated for all the shady shit you did in office but while you're still serving you can't have that big of a distraction. It's an interesting legal theory, but the practicality of it is completely wrong. It's one of those things where you can make a seemingly reasonable argument about the issue but the practical application of your solution is insane and clearly would never work. It's what I like to call an Antonin Scalia argument. In support, I would point to Scalia's concurring opinion in Citizens United v. FEC.	1	1590003934.0	/r/politics/comments/gnf28f/trump_tweets_conspiracy_theories_and_accuses/fr9um09/	5	This actually misstates the argument  A key piece of their immunity argument is that you can t be investigated WHILE PRESIDENT  So when you leave the office  you can be investigated for all the shady shit you did in office but while you re still serving you can t have that big of a distraction  It s an interesting legal theory  but the practicality of it is completely wrong  It s one of those things where you can make a seemingly reasonable argument about the issue but the practical application of your solution is insane and clearly would never work  It s what I like to call an Antonin Scalia argument  In support  I would point to Scalia s concurring opinion in Citizens United v  FEC

They will absolutely do it, because many of the ways Turnp has abused his power are cases where previous presidents were limited by convention instead of law.

Another part of the task is refine the structure of the executive so that it's more difficult for the president/adminstration to simply ignore the law.

Here's where I'm confused. Clearly the way to influence this isn't by voting useless third party (I say as someone that voted green in 2016 because I live in a non-competitive state). Maybe if the a third party got enough to actually pose a threat things would change, but I seriously believe a better model is just infiltrating existing power structures and influencing/dragging them in the direction we want. Clearly it worked for the Tea Party, wherein the smaller extreme corporatist/libertarian wing was able to wrest control of the GOP from the ""country club"" types.  How would it possibly be easier for the left to leave the power structure of the ""establishment"" Dems in place and try to drag them to the left from the outside? Esp. when they can start to occupy positions in the party and start dragging it in the correct direction? M4A is ONLY being talked about because Bernie ran as a Dem, because it's unfortunate but it's a huge platform.  If he'd run independent in 2016/2020 no way would he have broken through."	1	1590002389.0	/r/politics/comments/gnf28f/trump_tweets_conspiracy_theories_and_accuses/fr9r9kc/	2	" Biden is the example many need to understand  The Democratic establishment  since 1994  says whatever  positions left of Republicans garner votes  then  compromises  Republicans went hard right for 26 years since  and the Democratic establishment followed

This is absolute 100% bullshit. Almost all sane observers agree the US is in a dangerously regressive social movement and controlled by a political movement that has no inherent interest in the continuation of the rule of law. The GOP leaders (Bathtub-Drowing Norquist, Collapse the Admin State Bannon, Blind Narcissist Trump, Anarchocap Ryan, Theocrat Cruz, Agent of Chaos McConnell) have universally declared and made real political progress towards the destruction of the federal government in favor of oligarchic plunder.

Equating those two things is asinine (Webster: extremely or utterly foolish or silly), to the point it's difficult to believe you genuinely hold the position that ""both parties being right of global center means the outcome is irrelevant""

Pompeo Threw Lavish Dinners for Fox Hosts, GOP Megadonors—With Taxpayer Money		t5_2cneq	"Pompeo thinks and acts like Hermann Wilhelm Göring. Here is what Göring acted like.

""Goering was known for his extravagant tastes and garish clothing. He had various special uniforms made for the many posts he held; his Reichsmarschall uniform included a jewel-encrusted baton. 

Hans Ulrich Rudel, the top Stuka pilot of the war, recalled twice meeting Goering dressed in outlandish costumes: first, a medieval hunting costume, practicing archery with his doctor; and second, dressed in a red toga fastened with a golden clasp, smoking an unusually large pipe.


 Italian Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano once noted Goering wearing a fur coat that looked like what “a high grade prostitute wears to the opera”. He threw lavish housewarming parties each time a round of construction was completed at Carinhall, and changed costumes several times throughout the evenings. 


Hermann Goering was the most of his life morphine addicted, painted his feet and finger nails and played with little trains and toys.


Goering was noted for his patronage of music, especially opera. He entertained frequently and sumptuously, and hosted elaborate birthday parties for himself. Armaments minister Albert Speer recalled that guests brought expensive gifts such as gold bars, Dutch cigars, and valuable artwork. For his birthday in 1944, Speer gave Goering an oversize marble bust of Hitler. 

As a member of the Prussian Council of State, Speer was required to donate a considerable portion of his salary towards the Council’s birthday gift to Goering without even being asked."""	1	1590021758.0	/r/politics/comments/gnh3rl/pompeo_threw_lavish_dinners_for_fox_hosts_gop/fralzvn/	0	"Pompeo thinks and acts like Hermann Wilhelm Göring  Here is what Göring acted like

So when it becomes partisan, it's just a game to them. *Everyone's up to no good, and people complaining about wrongdoing are being disingenuous, just trying to score points,* they think, *so politics is just a game of 'catching' the other team. Playing defense, and scoring goals.*

Even if they don't all have the game aspect quite that literally expressed in their brains, this does seem to be the logic by which they proceed.

Taxpayers paid for food, a harpist, and goody bags for Pompeo's frequent 500-guest formal dinners		t5_2cneq	"""The Government is the Problem"" is consistent with language of bigots. It is not a principle of believing in no government or small government. ""The Government"" is a code word for Democratic Party. This is similar when people say ""Immigrants are the problem"", even though virtually everyone in the US are immigrants or descendants of immigrants. 

Republican voters and politicians have been consistent in believing in big Republican government for years. 

For example, Republican politicians like to say that they are pro-deregulation in energy when in reality they actively intervene the market to suppress renewable energy and support oil/coal/natural gas. This is a government by corny capitalists.

Another feature of Trump is rule by person instead of clearly defined regulations. Yes, there is less written and commonly understood regulations. The regulations are whatever Trump decides. During impeachment, Trump claimed unlimited power to do whatever he wants. The government is as big, if not bigger, but it is less fair.

EDIT: Someone responded that ""Can we not water down ""bigotry"" to include partisan politics?"". I replied the best I could to the person, but it went into ""both sides are same"" direction. 

My main points are

1. Racial bigotry is intertwined with partisan politics
2. Career civil servants and judges are supposed to be apolitical but Republican voters and politicians make them political. 
3. Republican voters and politicians dislike career civil servants and judges just because they are doing their jobs and don't not follow their bigotry.
4. In other words, they extend their racial bigotry by association.

Taxpayers paid for food, a harpist, and goody bags for Pompeo's frequent 500-guest formal dinners		t5_2cneq	"I didn't know anything about Earnhardts Jr politics so I googled, from wikipedia    
Politics
In a 2004 interview with Mike Wallace (not fellow competitor) on 60 Minutes, Earnhardt revealed himself to be a Republican and a supporter of President George W. Bush.[81] Despite this, he took his crew out to see the film Fahrenheit 9/11 earlier that year,[82][83] explaining, ""I like hearing both sides of the argument. I thought the movie was well done. But my dad was a Republican, and I'm a Republican, and so [it's] not that I came out of there going, 'I ain't voting for Bush again.' That didn't happen, and I didn't expect that to happen. I just wanted to go and enjoy the movie.""[81]

Earnhardt is a longtime opponent of the modern display of the Confederate flag at NASCAR events.[84] He wrote in his 2001 autobiography Driver #8 about his experience being asked about the flag in a Q&A at Richmond International Raceway (now Richmond Raceway) the previous year.[84] ""I think it means something different to me than it does to y'all..."" he responded.[84] He has distanced himself from race fans who display the flag, explaining, ""It never really was me.""[81] In 2006, Earnhardt told Dan Wetzel of Yahoo! Sports: ""We live in a country where you can speak freely and do as you may. I don't know (if) what that flag stands for is the same for me as it is the guy who might have it flying out there. I am not going to agree with everything everybody does all my life. So I don't have any control over it.""[85] Following the Charleston church shooting in 2015, Earnhardt told reporters: ""I think it's offensive to an entire race. It does nothing for anybody to be there flying, so I don't see any reason. It belongs in the history books and that's about it.""[86]

In January 2009, Earnhardt expressed enthusiasm following President Barack Obama's inauguration: ""I'm as excited as everybody else is about him. I wish I had been able to go to the inauguration. I would love to meet him. That would be a great honor.""[87]

In April 2012, Earnhardt became a partner of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity.[88] He addressed delegates to the 2012 Democratic National Convention at Charlotte Motor Speedway on behalf of the coalition.[89] In 2014, Earnhardt recorded an advertisement for America's Power, encouraging voter turnout for the U.S. elections that year.[90]

In May 2012, Earnhardt singled out Republican Representative Jack Kingston of Georgia while speaking against an amendment to a defense bill that would prohibit the military from funding sponsorships in professional sports.[91]

In January 2017, Earnhardt revealed that his family immigrated from Germany in the 1770s to escape religious persecution, saying ""America is created by immigrants.""[92][93] In August, he spoke out against hatred, bigotry and racism following the attacks in Charlottesville, Virginia and Barcelona, Spain.[94] In September, after protests of the U.S. national anthem gained traction following criticism from President Donald Trump, Earnhardt expressed support for peaceful protesters, quoting former president John F. Kennedy on Twitter: ""Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.""[95]"	1	1590003679.0	/r/politics/comments/gncz3f/taxpayers_paid_for_food_a_harpist_and_goody_bags/fr9u2dx/	1	"I didn t know anything about Earnhardts Jr politics so I googled  from wikipedia

The same thing happened in Germany in the late twenties the one percent needed a home grown authoritarian which they found in Hitler and his brown shirts they were the same crass brutish thugs that we have now. The Wiemar republic was a beacon of democracy and culture but it had It's problems like we do now and someone like Hitler seizes the opportunity to exploit the grievances of the public real or imagined doesn't really matter and they start telling them your life is terrible because of the greedy Jew or the migrant worker. The feed on the hatred cultivating to gain power and then start tearing down all the walls keeping an authoritarian from taking over. Trump is very much an admirer of Hitlers and would love to be him but there is one big difference trumps a moron and Hitler wasn't while Hitler used his masters to gain power they list control of him trumps not smart enough so I see a fascist dictatorship coming to America we are almost there it will be almost inperceptable you will still vote and the courts and Congress will still be there though in more of a ceremonial role easily over ruled if they do something the dictator doesn't like. So that is what's happening right now trump never pays a price for bad or illegal behavior because of a completely impotent congress and complicit supreme court every barrier to stop someone like him has over time and many administrations been weakened the point of collapse. I don't see Trump leaving office not just because he's often joked about it lets face it he has no sense of humor he told us the  plan and one last thing early into his first term he was meeting with generals and their wives and he quipped this is just the calm before the storm.

Trump is very much an admirer of Hitlers and would love to be him but there is one big difference trumps a moron and Hitler wasn't while Hitler used his masters to gain power they list control of him trumps not smart enough so I see a fascist dictatorship coming to America we are almost there it will be almost inperceptable you will still vote and the courts and Congress will still be there though in more of a ceremonial role easily over ruled if they do something the dictator doesn't like. So that is what's happening right now trump never pays a price for bad or illegal behavior because of a completely impotent congress and complicit supreme court every barrier to stop someone like him has over time and many administrations been weakened the point of collapse. I don't see Trump leaving office not just because he's often joked about it lets face it he has no sense of humor he told us the  plan and one last thing early into his first term he was meeting with generals and their wives and he quipped this is just the calm before the storm.

Take that with a Biden win in PA (Very, very likely) and the Electoral votes are 268 Biden to 270 Trump if every other state is the same as 2016.  So with those two states likely to flip blue again Biden only needs one more state to take the presidency.  In 2012 Obama won Iowa, WI, OH, and Florida where Hillary did not, only one of them would need to go Biden.  Or if the reports of Arizona flipping end up being true that would do it as well.  The even scarier thing for the GOP should be Texas.  IF Texas does eventually flip blue, which is possible but may take multiple more election cycles if at all, the GOP can win EVERY swing state like they did in 2016, and still lose the electoral college 270 to 268.  Dems should actively work very hard to try and truly flip Texas in the future because it would block out the GOP for good from the White House (And that's assuming swing states all vote like they did in 2016).

Trump Is Brazenly Interfering With the 2020 Election | The president appears to be gambling that openly tweeting his threats will let him get away with them.		t5_2cneq	"Well, a few reasons. First Trump won there in 2016 by a 0.235% margin. That's winning by 10,704 votes out of 4,548,382 votes cast. It's a traditionally Democratic state that looks like it may swing back in 2020. It carries with it 16 Electoral College votes.

My analysis starts with the 2016 Electoral College map and I can't really find any state that went for Clinton in 2016 that I think will go Trump in 2020. So Trump needs to hold what he won (306 EC votes - 270 needed to win). So if he loses any combination of three of these states, he loses the general: AZ, MI, PA, WI, FL, or GA. And in every one of these states Biden leads in the polls right now. And if Trump loses FL, then Biden only needs one more of these states.

Michigan isn't the only key state, but I'd say it's really an important one to watch.

Thereupon Congress shall decide the issue, assembling within forty-eight hours for that purpose if not in session. If the Congress, within twenty-one days after receipt of the latter written declaration, or, if Congress is not in session, within twenty-one days after Congress is required to assemble, determines by two-thirds vote of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall continue to discharge the same as Acting President; otherwise, the President shall resume the powers and duties of his office.

 Thereafter  when the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that no inability exists  he shall resume the powers and duties of his office unless the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive department or of such other body as Congress may by law provide  transmit within four days to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office  Thereupon Congress shall decide the issue  assembling within forty eight hours for that purpose if not in session  If the Congress  within twenty one days after receipt of the latter written declaration  or  if Congress is not in session  within twenty one days after Congress is required to assemble  determines by two thirds vote of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office  the Vice President shall continue to discharge the same as Acting President  otherwise  the President shall resume the powers and duties of his office 

So the tl dr is this  

Impeachment requires 50  1 of the House  and 67  of the Senate in order to remove the President

25th Amendment requires the Vice President  and the Cabinet  and 67  of the House  and 67  of the Senate in order to remove the President 

It is much   much  easier to remove via impeachment than via 25th Amendment"

That's not true. It was defined as ""contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person."" It included a wide range of activities. Clinton argued that his actions did not fit this definition. The most prominent example was a blowjob which did not involve HIM contacting any of those body parts (but Lewinsky did, so she probably had sexual relations with him without him having sexual relations with her), and I guess any contact he did have with those body parts wasn't with the intent of arousing or gratifying anyone's sexual desires."	1	1590011292.0	/r/politics/comments/gndvlx/legal_experts_say_trumps_threat_to_withhold/fra6ak1/	0	"  sexual relations  was explicitly defined as vaginal intercourse
