8,"I was the youngest of 3 girls in my family  My worst punishment came after my dad left  As a baby  my dad would beat my sisters for any little thing they did wrong but because I was born on his birthday  he saw me as  special  

My father was a drunk  drug addict who bought fear into the home and only I wasn t touched by his fists and feet 

My sisters and mom were all victims and while they tended their wounds I was smothered and loved 

They hated me for it 

Dad left and now no one was protecting me 

What was my worst punishment  I was locked up 

 My mom would lock in me in my room for hours and my sisters had free rein on me with their punishments 

Every time I stepped out of line  I was reminded how much hate there was 

I was beat by my sisters and neglected by my mother 

My worst punishment was when I said to my mom that I hated her and the family and I wished they were all dead  She grabbed me by the hair  dragged me into the laundry and locked me in there 

The floor was stone and it was winter  I remember being so cold it hurt 

I guess I was asleep when I was eventually let out 

I hated my punishments 

The locking up stopped when I was around 12 "

14,"7 years old  I wouldn t move my hands from my butt so my mom dragged me to the bathroom  While there she lifted me up by my legs and attempted to give me a swirly  My hands immediately latched on to the toilet bowl to stop my head from falling in  Then my mom freed up one of her hands to turn my ass red  

After a few hits my arms gave out and my head dropped hard into the toilet water  After that she yelled at me for 5 more minutes and ordered me to take a shower 

She still denies doing this or any of the other corporal punishment my sister and I were subjected to"

16,"Not me but my son actually  
He is a little fella  As are his mother and my self  She would force him to drink nothing but pediasure with every meal and go ballistic when he would not be able to finish the terrible frozen meal she made him  She sent a message to me saying he was hiding food he didn t want to eat and that she  beat his ass  and I should  expect bruising     The next day my father picks him up and dropped him off to my girlfriend at our house  After dinner she went to put him in the shower and was horrified at what she saw  Imagine a tiny 7 year old boy with a completely bruised ass  And I mean deep purple  yellow and green bruises  She called me immediately  I rushed home from work  calling the police on my way  A Sargent from my local pd was very helpful and supportive to my little boy  Told me what to file and how to file it and that I should rush to children s hospital  He also called his lifelong best friend who is a captain in the town where my ex wife lives  Within 2 weeks I had full emergency custody and she had domestic violence charges  Fast forward a year and I m a sole custodial parent and my son is THRIVING  He has gained almost 20 lbs  Can now ride a bike without training wheels  He could not ride one at all when we took custody  Good food  Positive attention  And lots of love have helped him grow tremendously "
17,Got put on restriction for 6 months for doing something my mom said I could do  But then she said she never gave me permission to do even though another adult was sitting there and confirmed he heard her give me permission to do it  Also had to pick up all the rocks in the vacant lot next to our house and put them in a pile on weekends as part of the punishment

24,"My Dad used to tell us he d sell us to the gypsies if we didn t behave   Once you get a bit older you realise he s bluffing  at least I hope he was     

This led to one hilarious incident when my Dad shouted at my 7 year old brother that he was  gonna get the gypsies and make them come get him    He picked up the phone and started dialing a number   My 7 year old brother smiled  knowing full well he wasn t really but my 4 year old brother burst into tears and ran to my Dad screaming  Nooooo  nooooo  don t sell Benny to the   yippies   chippies    Please  Don t do it   bawling his eyes out 

Total backfire 

Edit   Oh   It wasn t  yippies   it was  chippies  my youngest brother called them   In the UK  that s a slang word for a fish and chip shop  a takeaway place "
25,My mom pulled down my pants and hit me with the brush side of a hairbrush   in front of my three fellow 5 year old friends   I was innocent  She didn t believe me 
26,"Some guy my mom brought home that she was dating  got really drunk  and took me in the bathroom and beat me with a belt  He said it would be 20  licks    but he was so drunk he kept losing count  I tried crawling behind the toilet for protection but couldn t fit  That just made him more angry  I tried not to cry because I learned they enjoyed that  but I couldn t help it  I don t remember anything after that

I m still afraid of the dark and loud noises "
28,"My mom said I couldn t have a best friend anymore because my best friend and I were drawing pentagrams on MS Paint at our afterschool program  pretending they were transmutation circles from an anime called Fullmetal Alchemist  pentagrams are much easier for a 9 year old to draw than an intricate alchemy array   My mom immediately jumped to this being devil worshipping  despite my friend and I not even knowing what a pentagram really meant  This lead to my mom telling every single teacher and after school care worker not to allow me to be anywhere near my friend  Friend moves away and mom won t let me email her to stay in touch  I m 24 now and haven t had any close friends since

I still have major teeth and jaw problems at 22  and my stomach esophagus has never felt normal "

I cried  And never cursed again until I was 21 "
34,"this may sound really low but it was really hard for me when i was a child  

i was really bad at math but my mom was really good at it  she graduated valedictorian during her college years   so  every summer  instead of playing with my friends outside  she made me study math  advanced topics  the whole summer  i became really lonely as she would shout at me whenever my dumbass couldn t understand a topic and i would always cry  that was the worst punishment i ever received when i was a child  but now that im a teenager  math is still hard for me but once i listen hard enough to my teacher  i can easily understand everything "
35,"When I was 14 during an entrance interview to a high school I didn t want to go to with the headmistress and my dad by my side  I told the honest truth to the headmistress  I didn t want to go there  though it was a lovely school  I just wasn t up for it as politely as I could  It snot like it was a secret  she could pretty much see the misery on my face  I had valid reasons that I gave to my parents several times before  but my dad is hella strict so still made me apply to that school 

We got home and my dad was furious  He took my phone and the door to my room  I went to bed early and in the middle of the night  he came to my room  told me to get up and draw the curtains  I only had underwear and a t shirt on  As I got up he used a long mwiko  basically wooden cooking stick  of around 16 inches to whack the shit out of me  I screamed in pain  but this guy didn t care he hit me everywhere  bruises and scars like I had never seen until the stick broke and he took off his slipper and continued to hit me for like 10 15 minutes saying how he felt disrespected and who I thought I was acting like that  

I never saw him the same way again  I still shudder a little when I hear his voice and when he touches me  even for a hug and I m 19 

I ended up going to a different school  meeting my parents half way  not perfect  but definitely much better "
36,Slapped across the face as a 12 year old girl by my father when I burned nachos in the microwave  This was the first time he slapped me  so I remember it well  He used to spank me  but switched to open handed slaps to the face when I got  too old for spanking  
37,"I told my brother to fuck off and die  I turned around to a 2x4 to the chest then spent 8 hours total picking up tiny ass rocks out of the yard and putting them in a bucket  When the bucket was full my dad would walk around the yard throwing them around  then i d pick them back up again 

  x200B 

Edit  For those asking a 2x4 is a piece of wood used in construction  If you were to open up the walls of your house many of you would find 2x4 cut into 8 or 9 feet lengths used to frame your house apartment dwelling "
38,Not me but one of my siblings  We were quite young and they didn t want to finish all the food on their plate  So my step dad duct taped them to the dining room chair and wouldn t let them out until they finished 
39,"So my dad found an old wooden hockey stick that was thrown away  he saw it and thought it d make a great weapon to beat us with  He called it Mr  Sticko and he broke over my back for something I did  That one really sucked 


Edit  Hey guys  thank you so much for the well wishes and cake day shoutouts  they mean a lot  So my dad and I are actually kind of good  we obviously don t have a great relationship  but growing up in a community where my friends had it just as bad it never seemed weird until I left  I got much needed therapy and anger management to learn how to solve my issues without violence  Thank you again "
40,"I got the wooden spoon a lot and once my mom was soo angry  not particularly at me just in general which is more messed up  that she threw a porcelain tea pot at the back of my head while I was going down the stairs  

But the scariest beating I saw happened to my best friend in high school  We were supposed to be having a sleepover at her house but instead we went out and partied till 3am  When we got to her house her dad was up  I m pretty sure he was drunk  and he was pissed  He beat her with a field hockey stick for what seemed like forever  She was in bad shape  Sufficed to say I never slept over there again 

Edit  For everyone asking if I called the cops or reported her dad two things  I was 15 y o and never experienced anything like that in my life  I was definitely in shock and scared for my life as this was unfolding  Obviously that s not an excuse  I later mentioned to her that I was thinking about telling someone but she begged me not to as her mom was not in the picture and she was the only one taking care of her younger brother and did not want to be separated from him  She moved out with her brother as soon as we graduated high school "
41,Just predicting this thread gonna have a lot of straight up torture in it

43,"Definitely the  Buck Rag   I still feel sick thinking about it 

For those who don t know  a Buck Rag is a rag that s been rubbed all over a male goat in rut  It s used for some goat breeding purposes  lady goats love the smell  

In our town  some parents would buy these rags from goat farmers to punish children for misbehaving  You take the child out back  pull the rag out of the jar  drape it over the child s face  and tie a knot in the back  It s not dangerous  but it makes them smell the horrible goat odor 

I never saw what the big deal was until I was  Buck ragged  as a 16 year old girl for cursing out my parents  I puked  A lot "
44,"My mother cancelled my birthday one year  I was being a mouthy little shit and didn t believe she would follow through once she presented it as a potential consequence for my behavior  Turns out my mother doesn t make empty threats

47,"I had poison ivy put all over my back  so guess how I turned out lol
Tip  lightly rub some sandy dirt on it 

Had friends whose parents forced them over fire with hot spices thrown in it   gladly the general consensus is that this is an outdated and terrible cultural practice in punishing anyone  so less of it is happening nowadays

Edit  imagine hot spices    Now imagine breathing the smoke that comes from burning those spices  It s used to be a torcher technique in East Africa  You don t wanna have a person in that kind of smoke for more than a few seconds because they ll die before giving you the intel you need 

Edit 2  I got my first award  thank you so much  I m gonna show it to my parents and prove that I m worth something "
48,"Parents put me to bed for the day   at like 3PM  I laid in bed looking out the window watching the other kids play outside while sweating my ass off in the blankets  

I used to get ass beatings and would def take those over that creative punishment"
49,Not as horrible as some of the other comments on here  but one time I told my mom to shut up when i was about 5 or so  and she slapped me on the mouth  causing one of my little baby teeth  which was wiggly  to pop out  Can t tell if i was more grateful to get the little shit out of my mouth or shocked that she slapped me   
50,This thread is like a stroll down not so repressed memory lane  Holy crap I m sorry for the legit abusive things some of you endured 
51,Honestly  I could withstand almost any punishment  physical or otherwise  pretty well even as a child  It just never bothered me  The worst punishment I received was having my phone  car and laptop taken away for a crime I didn t commit  Basically  my parents found a fifth of expensive Scotch Whisky missing from the liquor cabinet and blamed me until about a week later when one of our family friends called thanking them for the gift  They had somehow both completely forgotten all about it  Getting in trouble when I was innocent was what really got to me 
52,ITT  prove how many people shouldnt be parents or near other humans really 
53,Fuck this thread is dark
54,My mom put me on  dog restrictions  when I was 8 or so years old  I wasn t allowed to pet  look at  or interact with either of our dogs for 48 hours  I was so upset  I loved my dogs sooooo much  It hurt my feelings so much when they walked over to me and I had to ignore them   Also  getting switched was pretty awful  For those that don t know  a switch is a long thing branch from a willow tree used to spank a child  Talk about leaving some welts on your ass  Woo whee that shit hurt  I can still hear the whistling sound it made as the switch was slicing through the air 
55,My sister and I were constantly watching Star Wars and quoting Star Wars and playing with Star Wars toys that it drove my parents to ban all Star Wars related things in the house for 3 months

I had a bad progress report in middle school so I forged my moms signature on it  Got caught  Honestly  the writing was so shaky and my writing is terrible at the jump  don t know how I thought that was a good shot  

When the school called my parents they said they d talk to me when I got home  They said I had to decide what my punishment was  Obvious trap  too hard on yourself and that sucks  Too lenient and they come down hard  That choice was worse than the actual punishment "
57,my worst punishment was when i was 13  I went out with my friend who i ve known for years  we went just around my neighborhood and park nearby for hours  my mom was absolutely pissed about it  i was grounded for 6 months  with no electronic usage  i wasn t allowed to see any of my friends  i was a literal hostage in my own house  i ve never felt so alone and disappointed in myself and i felt awful for my friend who had to go through that with me

59,My mother tied me  naked  to my step sister s bed and beat me with an extension cord until my back  butt  and leg were bleeding  She then dragged my step sister in by her arm and asked her if she was happy about the severity of the beating  I was arguing with my step sister earlier and hurt her feelings so she told her dad  He fussed at me for saying mean things and it embarrassed my mother

61,Grounded from Halloween after a couple weeks of neglecting chores and being caught playing video games under the covers on a school night  Our whole neighborhood had a block party and I could hear all the trick or treating from my room  Didn t even score the reject candy after my sisters came home  either 
62,I don t remember what I did wrong but I got hit with a belt whenever I did something wrong as a kid  One time it was so bad cause my dad beat me with the end that had the belt buckle which was huge and it said cruising  I had that tattooed all over my arms and legs and body as bruises  I showed my mom the next morning and she kept me from going to school for a few days so the bruises went away so my dad wouldn t get in trouble  She bitched him out and he apologized  I still grew up in total fear of my father so bad instead of doing better in school I just forged  their signatures on the progress reports from school  Yeah I have major depression and anxiety problems never had a real stable relationship with other people  I now live with my parents cause of a disability and we disagree on a lot of things I just keep to myself cause if I share my opinion I m liable to be punched  Like living in my own personal hell cause if you don t do things my way ir believe like I do then your are the enemy

We don t talk "
66,Silence punishment  My stepdad was a real bag of shit and I often talk back to him  In return he forced my mother and little brother to ignore me  I didn t have any friends at the time  so sometimes I didn t talk to anyone for whole weeks  All of his  teaching life  techniques screwed me up for years 
67,When I was young and taking interest in girls my parents made a rule with no girls over at the house alone with me  even to study all doors open  no locks  This all happened after I got caught in a compromising situation with my girlfriend at church  Went on like that for a while until I was 14 15  a friend of mine who was on the weight lifting team was over at my house one day  He was changing in my room and my parents walked in with him in his boxers and me sitting on my bed  I still remember that moment  they both pause look at each other and it got weird for a couple days  When they finally said something  it was very positive towards me seeing women  got a lock on my door and girls were very welcome in the house alone with me  even got a few  why don t you ever bring that one girl around more often   My parents really didn t want me to be gay 
68,"Had my door taken off the hinges  and all of my belongings  sans bed and dresser  taken out of my room  Some got sold  some tossed  some given to my younger sibling  This punishment lasted a full 4 months  Just because I dropped from a  B  to a  C  in one class in high school

73,"My mom once made me smell her feet for 10 minutes for backtalk  She switched to that once they banned  soap in the mouth  in my state 

Honest question   can these sort of punishments lead to fetishes later on  Cause I wonder if that caused my foot fetish   "
74,"I was bad at school so my mom took all of my furniture  Literally all of it  I had to sleep and eat on the floor for a week  She did let me keep my favorite blanky tho

77,"I was 14 and my 4 younger siblings and I were taken in by our grandfather after my mom lost custody of us to the state  They were radical Catholics who sexually abused my baby sister and forced us to do lots of things children should not be subjected to 

They read my diary  Surprise  they didn t like what they saw  My only prior offense was shoplifting some earrings from a Claire s 

They charged me with conspiracy to commit murder  They put me into handcuffs and took me through a hidden exit  from the school   I was taken in a police car to the psychiatric unit of the local hospital where I played guitar hero for the first time  From there I was taken 80 miles away to another town  to a home for wayward youths  

There I learned lots of new tricks and schemes  but did not use these for ill gains as my fellow inmates did  I was scheduled for release two months after entry  My therapist was fighting for us because she knew I didn t belong there and I only wanted to get home and take care of my little siblings  Luckily once our Indian tribe got wind of the fucked up situation  they ordered their own investigations  We were then reunited as a family after a horrible life altering ordeal 

I did not graduate high school after losing four months total of schoolwork freshman year after my moms DUI  I did get my GED and I still love learning and writing 

I do not keep a diary "
78,"This is a dark comment section   hope you guys are doing okay now and away from that abuse 

I used to babysit my toddler cousin and when she would act up and throw tantrums I would put her on  The Naughty Cushion  as punishment  Basically just a cushion she wasn t allowed to move off of for a few minutes until she calmed down  

One day she was throwing a huge tantrum over not being allowed to play with her toys instead of eating her dinner  She was put on the naughty cushion for 5 minutes and told not she was not allowed to move from it 

I turned my back for two seconds and the mischievously clever little bean was scooting her butt on the naughty cushion across the floor towards her toys  technically not breaking the naughty cushion rule  I just let it happen because I thought it was so damn funny and smart for a toddler to come up with a workaround like that"
79,I was about to say my worst but then I read the top few comments and decided I didnt have it so bad  My condolences to all of you that suffered 
80,"When I was acting up as a little kid once  my Mom took all my Barney VHS tapes I had just gotten as a gift from my Aunt and donated them  Looking back now though  my Mom admits she was wrong to do that and has apologized 

She never did anything like that ever again and otherwise she s a great Mom to me  so I accepted it "
81,"I used to run away from home a lot   it was harmless I used to just be at my neighbours and come back at night   So I was tied up in the sun for hours to prevent me from running away

I asked my dad to simply beat me   he wouldn t do it  Assholes  😂"
83,"I got scolded on my 10th birthday for accidentally tripping and spilling spaghetti  We were having the party outside and it was getting dark so I wanted to help put things away  So I started carrying the left over spaghetti and tripped causing it to spill on the pavement 

My parents were furious at me and sent me to my room  I apologized to them telling that it was an accident but they didn t let up and yelled at me some more 

I went to my room crying with my siblings coming upstairs to comfort me while my parents were still yelling  

That was the worst birthday I ever had  To this day  I never told my parents about it because they would be too embarrassed or ashamed about what they did to a 10 year old kid "
84,I grew up in a very abusive home in western new york  There were many  worst  punishments handed out  but one that sticks out the most happened one summer when I was about 8 years old  My stepfather stripped me down and tied me to a post with a chain that and locked it with a padlock around my neck  I am a very fair skinned individual so I burned up real fast  I was also beaten with a wooden switch every hour until I admitted   What I had done wrong   Every time I gave a wrong answer   and I did a lot because I had no idea what he was talking about   I was beaten again  I spent 4 days tied to that post  Day and night  hungry  thirsty  and very scared  The only comfort was a golden retriever that would settle in next to me every time my stepfather went back inside  On the fourth day  an Amish kid from the farm next door came down and cut my chain  His name was Charlie   We went to the police but back then the police were largely indifferent when it came to child abuse and they returned me home  I was forced to live inside the dog house for the remainder of the summer until school started again  Typical life in my house growing up

86,When I was 8 years old  my mentally unstable mom duct taped me to a chair  turned the lights off and left me in my room for something like 8 plus hours  When she returned I was still sobbing and had pissed myself  I told my teacher about it at school  and started crying  So she told DHS  they came by the house and saw how crazy my mom was  Then I was placed at my dads house permanently  they got divorced when I was younger  and my mom hated my dad so much  that she kidnapped me on one of her visitation days  The cops found us about a week later    i have blocked out most of the horrible things that happened when I was with her full time  I just remember feeling relieved that I was in the cops car and he was being nice to me  Later as an adult  I forgave my mom  Tried to let her in my life  but she kept refusing to get mental help  So I cut her out again  Then when I was in my mid 20 s  I found out that she had died from stage 4 breast cancer  and I didn t know it happened for about 4 months or so  My brother kept it from me and her entire family  They always had an unhealthy relationship  he was like her little bitch boy  She could do no wrong when it came to him  Basically I m glad she s no longer alive  causing people pain  She was a clinical narcissist with personality disorders  I m now almost 40 years old  and I realize that she was mentally unstable  and karma is real  Love you mom  but I never liked you  RIP 
87,My mum spent the entire daying making dinner  Picky little mini me didn t feel like eating  So she pulled me by the hair and sent me flying to my room to lock me in it  When she threw me in  I hit the corner of the bed and cut my head open  I almost died because I didn t feel like mashed potatoes 
88,"Prob gonna get buried  and a lot of stuff that happened to me as a kid has already been put in here  but I always had a high pain tolerance so my worst ones involved embarrassment 

Some neighborhood kids were staying the day while their family was at work  and we were outside playing  One of the kids  a notorious neighborhood bully  ran inside and told my mom that I had pushed him  

She proceeded to make me stand with my legs spread as far as they could  bend over and hold my self up in kind of a triangle position 

I wasn t allowed to move or use the bathroom  

I was there for about 12 hours  well past sundown  

I shit and pissed myself  and my piss rolled down my stomach chin into my mouth  

I was made to sleep on a cot outside and in the morning she washed me off with a hose  

I was bullied my whole life for that one "

91,"I accidentally forgot a pair of underwear that I needed to pick up and take to my room when I was 6  My mother was a huge neat freak and flipped out  She got my bedroom door open and grabbed me by the back of my neck and shoved me to the bathroom  She then threw me on the floor and was screaming about picking it up  I did and she told me to put it in the hamper  I ran  because I knew how she was  and tripped  She grabbed me by the collar and lift me up and choked me against the wall with her hands  I legit couldn t breathe  She let me go before I passed out  screamed at me to put it in the hamper  I did  And then she told me to go get the belt  I cried and begged her to not  It makes me sick to think of how she could handle a small child saying  please no mama  Please please no  I ll be good  I promise  I m sorry Mama  Please no   When I didn t get the belt she grabbed a wire hanger from my closet  I tried to run and she grabbed me and ripped my pants down and beat me  I was bloody and bruised all down my back and legs  

That s just one of them that my brain found less horrifying and didn t block out  A lot of them I don t remember 

Edit  got emotional writing and had to fix typos "
92,my mom found out my sister was suicidal so she locked my sister in her room with literally nothing but a blanket  and maybe an air mattress  she was only let out to use the restroom  food and clothes were brought up to her and then taken when she was finished   my mom told me about this when i was about 8 or 9  im 19 now and i have never and will never tell her about any of my mental health issues for fear of my life
93,I got my Mouse Trap game taken away when I was like 9 and I ll never forget it 
94,Practically water boarded with cold showers  When I was young I was forced to get naked and sprayed with a cold shower and my parents would watch and make sure I couldn t escape the stream of water as punishment  It was mentally damaging being curled up naked in front of my parents getting sprayed down by them while begging them to stop 
95,"No one ever sees when I comment on these ask reddits  but the worst one is probably when my dad shot me in the leg with a  22  Tried to stop him from beating his gf by calling him a cock sucker  apparently he used to suck dick for drugs  and that made him mad he came back outside and pointed the gun at me and said  say it again  Wtf did you call me   so I screamed it again and he shot me

97,"I got legitimately thrown across a room  No joke  I was 10 and was actually physically picked up and thrown about 10 feet by my dad 

My mum wasnt in the house at the time either and still doesn t know because I dont know how to bring it up to her 

The situation was me and my siblings were playing the Wii  and my dad came in to tell us to tidy up  I was sorta pissed  so as I took my school bag out the room it hit my brother s face 

It would of only hurt a bit realistically 

My dad got pissed as fuck for some reason and thought it was a good idea to throw me across the room 

He realised what the fuck he just did and left the room  I had landed on the sofa  but broke my arm  I told my mum I tripped over and my siblings and I still hold that secret "
98,"I had a few ones I didn t like  One time my sister  clogged  the toilet and blamed it on me  my dad was pissed because I kept denying it  He then handed me a trash bag and told me to clean it out with my hands  Another time I had left a box on the stairs and got the belt  My parents hate a messy house but they never clean

99,"Let me preface this by saying that I have autism and find social interaction difficult 

My best friend from school had come round to play and I wanted to show him my Thomas the Tank Engine toy I got  He then said  oh thanks Mitchell   Obviously thinking I was giving it to him  I corrected him and that it s mine  I m just showing it to him 

Mum overheard this and came raging at me  She took the toy from my hands and bounced it on the floor like a basketball  It didn t work after this 
But I guess I didn t seem too affected by this  because later that day  while I was watching TV  she came downstairs holding this cardboard periscope I made a few weeks ago  She then proceeded to drop it on the floor and stomp it flat  ripping the cardboard in the process  I didn t really show much emotion to that as I just gave a very quick cry  then immediately resumed watching TV 

She s never done anything like that again  but I still don t show her  or anyone else  anything I create from the fear that she ll use it against me  And I do create a lot now  I have a 3d printer and I love it  and I m learning woodwork as well  But I keep my creations rather secret "
100,"Carry over from a post I had made previously

When I was about 7 my mother and step dad at the time bought a new couch  You know the type a nice new leather couch  Well later that day my parents left for some reason I can t remember why  Maybe the went to the neighbor s house  Well while they were gone me and my little brother who was 3 years younger then me devised a plan  I had recently discovered that sharp objects could stab into cardboard boxes  and it was a fun little game  We found some boxes in the garage  And I took the knives out of the kitchen drawer  We positioned the boxes on top of the couch and stab the boxes a bunch of times  not realizing you were stabbing right through them into the couch  After we were done we realized our mistake  Knowing my stepdad would be furious I hid the knives in our walk in closet  And threw the boxes in the trash outside  I then put a blanket over the couch to hide it 

When my step dad came home  it wasn t hard for him to figure out what we had done  He flew into a rage grabbed me by my shirt and yelled at me  He screamed at me and asked what I had done  My brother was already crying by this point  I told him about the boxes and the knives  He then asked where the knives were at  and I told him in the closet  He opened the closet door and found them  he picked me up by the shirt and threw me into the closet  As I landed I felt the knife s pierced through my thighs  my butt  and my hands  He screamed at me  Don t fucking move  he then attempted to slam the closet shut but my right leg was still in the doorway  He then grabbed my little brother by the throat with his right hand picked him up off the ground and pinned him against the wall  He choked my brother until he was blue  at this point I was trying to collect myself  I stood up and noticed that only one of the knives was still stuck in me  I pulled the knife out of my thigh  and limped over to my step dad  I hit him in the back and told him to stop  He then let go of my brother and his lifeless body fell to the ground unconscious  He turned around and grabbed me by the hair dragging me into the kitchen  He grabbed the wooden pizza paddle then dragged me back into the living room  He then bent me over his leg and hit me on the butt  Every time I would squirm or try to run away he would hit my thighs  My legs would flail and I would scream for about the first 20 hits  I lost track of how many times he hit me but my body went limp  When he was done he threw me to the floor where I laid until my mother got home  At this point my brother had regained consciousness and was crying  My step dad walked over to him grabbed him by the back of his shirt collar and dragged him to the living room  He pulled off his belt and whipped him in his back until my brother stopped screaming  I pissed myself from the pain that day  When he realized that he grabbed me and dragged me over to the couch  pulled down my pants  he then threw me onto the couch  and told me to stay there  He was screaming at me saying  oh so we want to pee our fucking pants now   well if you can t be a big boy I ll fucking teach you  he went to the bathroom and grabbed one of my sister s diapers  He then forced me into the diaper and paddled me again  My little brother ran out of the house at this time  My step dad chased him down and dragged him back in by his hair   He then threw us in our room locked the door with something  and we stayed in there for the rest of the night  There was no police report filed  no neighbors called the cops  and my mother didn t say anything "
101,i hate to be that one to say it but my mum had an abusive boyfriend  one morning leading up to Christmas i woke up really early  obviously it was pitch black dark  so i did what any child would do and go downstairs to watch TV  since it was dark i turned on this little over head lamp thing and just sat and watched the TV for a while  at some point i must ve fell asleep because i woke up to the sound of my mums boyfriend shouting at me to wake up  when i woke up he ripped into me for having the light on during the day time because it was  wasting electricity   his punishment for this was to grab my hand and force me to grab onto the light that i had left on  obviously it was extremely hot  it was actually so hot i remember it made my hand sizzle like bacon in a hot pan  it was relatively brief but it was long enough to leave me with a scar and unable to open my own Christmas presents that year  any questions feel free to ask   
102,My parents never really punished me so much but my older sister would put a lot of ice cubes in my butt crack and make me sit like that until they melt for misbehaving when she would be in charge  It burned like hell  And I thought it was normal back then

Same woman beat me with a paddle then said I fell off my bike  And would destroy my dad and I s Lego creations and say I did it because I hated him  

Wasn t a happy time in life for me "
109,"Got the piss and shit beaten outta me  literally  after taking the wrap for my brother  who had been stealing change out of my dad s coin jar  Then the next day my grandma whipped my palms with a belt repeatedly and then forced me to write  stealing is wrong  I will not steal  on a piece of paper 100 times 

30 years later and my brother still hasn t thanked me for it  That was the first and last time I decided I d ever do that  because I knew he d need to learn about consequences 

He never learned  and to this day he still blames everyone else for his problems  while I m thriving

110,My dad always told my brother and I that he was going to have cps take us away because he hated us  Gotta love those long term crippling fears of abandonment 
111,They did things like that to people in concentration camps  Just a worthless task over and over  I ll never forget learning that 
112,My mom used to do the whole  waking me up in the middle of the night for some perceived wrong doing  stuff  She would suddenly and loudly throw my door open  turn on the light and drag me out of bed at all hours  I m pretty sure I m a light sleeper and regularly wake up startled because of that  I m 40   I swore I would NEVER do that shit to my kids 
113,I hate your stepdad   That s fucking terrible   I hope you never have to see him

117,"My dad did something similar when I was in third grade 

  x200B 

He caught me watching Youtube once  and he got really mad I live in a pretty strict family   He told me to go to the basement and sit there with my pants and underwear down  and wait for him to find something to beat me with  I sat there crying for like 2 hours  imagining what he was going to get I was 9   During these two hours  he keeps slapping the closed basement door with miscellaneous items to scare me  Finally  he comes down  and goes   WTF are you doing  with your pants down  Go do your homework  "
118,A cousin of mine has a similar story  he got in trouble for cutting class when he was younger and his Mom made a show of calling his father  which she did  and the kid knew he was going to be punished so he bawled his eyes out until his dad got home from work  and his dad got home and told him he loved him and to not do it again  The fear of punishment is the punishment itself 
119,Lol my mom broke the cartilage in my ear like this  It turned blackish and hurt when the wind blew  thought I had an ear infection  She took me to the doctor  guy says this shit broke what happened  I hadn t realized what happened until the doctor asked me  and I thought for a few seconds and saw my mother staring at me  and I went   I I fell     I always thought I just saved this bich a really awkward situation lol
120,Once i was left out front  4 yearold me thought  Huh  Imma go over there   They couldnt find me because i was going to the park  Down the road  On my own  In the cold 
121,My parents locked me and my two sisters several times in a stall  I couldn t reach over and unlock it  for hours late at night  I keep reading these stories people have   it s bringing up old memories 
122,"I was walking home one day and I saw that my neighbor  that was largely ignored  had her foster son locked out of the house  Couldnt have been more than three years old  He was screaming because he was bleeding  pawing at the door and crying  i need a tissue  I need a tissue   When i called to him and asked him if he needed help  he froze and the door immediately flew open and he was dragged inside by his arm 

I called child services "
123,That s really messed up  how are you now 
124,How was that explained to the doctor 
125,Your dad pulled a Jack Torrance on you
126,I tried doing the same when my father did that  Only I hit my head and almost cracked my skull 
127,Exact same thing happened to me  I ll never forget her seething rage look when she said  Look  what  you  made  me  DO   emphasizing each word with a spank 
128,That s fucked  Atleast my mom stopped and called it if she broke the wooden spoon 
129,This reminds me of the time my mom was attacking me  and she hit me twice in the face  The third time I grabbed her hand  which pissed her off more  and she decided to strike me harder with the other one  She was always proud of that for some reason  like me protecting my god damn face was somehow punishable by getting hit harder 
130,Wow  2 and a half yrs old and only weighed 15lbs  My son weighed 16lbs at 4months  Smh  Some ppl just should not have kids  My hope for you is that you live  thrive and find peace

Also glad you are okay and was able to make it out of that horrible situation "
135,Strangling sucks  Around the time I was 12 or 13  my stepdad strangled me with my little cousins downstairs simply because I was annoying him  I honestly thought I was going to die  He did a lot of shitty things  but that was the worst

138,"My mom used to literally back me into a corner then start swinging  She d stop after she got tired or thought I  learned my lesson   The next day she d buy me a shitty little crystal knickknack from the drugstore as an apology  It would happen about twice a year  I d threaten to call the police  she d say  They wont believe you and arrest you for lying  

This went on for years 

One day  when I was 16  she thought I was being mouthy so she walked up behind me and backhanded me in the back of my head  I had enough of it and pushed her away  She started screaming to my dad that I was attacking her   he came in and put his hands on me and I wrapped my hands around his throat until he tapped and and was begging me to stop  I left home for almost a month  couch surfing and probably putting myself in way too dangerous situations for a minor  I didn t go back home until my dad finally apologized to me when he got the truth of what happened from my mom  As soon as I got back home I gave away or tossed all the shitty crystal apology gifts from my mom  

I confronted my mother about all this a couple years ago on Mother s Day  She denies any of it ever happening and claimed  I think I d remember if that happened   My dad can t verify any of it since she d always do it while he was at work  But he got real quiet when I mentioned it  I m pretty sure he knows it happened and feels guilty that he never knew 

I m 32 years old now  I m on good terms with both of my parents  Well  in all truth  I m on good terms with my dad and I can tolerate my mother  I ve never forgiven her or ever forgotten what she did  She can claim whatever she wants but I  know  what happened  I have the scars and fractures which never quite healed right  I have the occasional nightmares about it to this day  I can only hope that I rise above it all and don t make petty decisions when I m in control and she s helpless 

I m so sorry for what happened to you and further sorry for dumping all this bullshit here  You know what happened despite what she claims  Don t ever feel bad about staying true to yourself and what happened  All you can do now is hope that the future brings the best for yourself due to your own strength and perseverance 

EDIT 
Thanks for overwhelming support and kind thoughts in response to this post  My heart goes out to everyone who responded and shared their own stories  If nothing else  you all should know that you re not alone in this world and didn t deserve what happened when you were a child  You ve made it this far and now are free to live your life as you see fit and enjoy every single moment "

149,"pediatric fecal retention syndrome  my daughter has this  It isn t your fault 

Edit  for small children infants over 12 months  daily use of Restorolax or fibre based laxative  Older children can use this as well  but are more likely to learn not to use the wrong muscles when defecating  The restoralax stops the pain fear cycle as the child learns it won t hurt anymore to go 

Basically the infant begins solid foods  The poo becomes more solid and some constipation is normal at this stage  which is why there is baby pureed prunes to help   

However some babies will  posture   looks like masturbating and may eventually become a masturbation method  their legs in a rhythmic pattern as they are using the incorrect muscle in the rectum and are instead holding the poo  usually to try to prevent the poo from coming out and hurting  or sometimes just because they figure out the pooing sensation to push incorrectly  

This poo then gets bigger and harder because it dries out  causing megastools and the body finally forces it out and they can experience severe pain from this  making the cycle next time worse as they try to prevent it  Diarrhea is also a symptom of constipation  

There is functional constipation as well  which is different  but may be related  

Now that my daughter is older  4  she is still on a capful of Restoralax a day  pediatrician told to do so   it can t harm her  However potty training is delayed as she is afriad of anything to do with defecation 

What ALSO happens is the parent or doctor or teacher becomes frustrated and may start harsh discipline and punishment for the child not defecating properly  making it an anxiety related thing "
150,"What s worse is he probably thinks he  fixed  you  

Sorry you had such a shitty experience "

152,Yes  but with a whimsical feathered aspect you don t see in a good caning 
153,I ve heard of this one at least 
154,I know from my parents that in the former USSR this punishment was fairly common  but with salt instead of rice  So glad they didn t inherit this mindset  but they are very good at psychological punishment 
155,I think this one was a form torture in imperial Russia 
156,Tell me more about them  my grandparents would tell me that the nuns were hell
157,The nun at my elementary school taught piano lessons  I suffered through lessons in first and second grad with her  She had this little metal switch  like an old car antenna  and if you messed up she would switch you across the knuckles  If you kept messing up she switch your head  And this was in the fucking 90s  She died when I was in middle school  I ve never seen so many kids smiling at a funeral before

168,That s rough buddy  My friends mom was the smartest woman on Earth though  Growing up she would reward us with a pack of Pokémon cards for completing a list of chores  but if we were being really misbehaved she would pull out a pack  open it  show us the contents of the pack and then rip up the cards  The woman ripped up a fucking Charizard in front of two ten year olds and an 8 year old  We didn t act out much after that devastating blow 
169,It s such a betrayal when a parent doesn t believe their child  I m sorry that happened to you

My mom used to punish my sister and I whenever we wet the bed or had an accident  I got over it eventually but my sister wet the bed for years after she was potty trained  Mom would make us wear a diaper or tell people we weren t potty trained  She was basically trying to shame us into not having accidents "

183,Damn  I wish you well being 
184,Wow  occasionally drinking vinegar for a punishment affected you that bad physically  What does it do to you  How much were they making you drink 
185,That s a literal health hazard right there 
186,That s absolutely disgusting
187,What would he have done if you said  fuck  
188,Damn  It would have only been worse if he shat on the spot to use instead of dog poo 
189," I never saw him the same way again  I still shudder a little when I hear his voice and when he touches me  even for a hug and I m 19 

That s trauma for you

R u still living with him "
190,"That s awful   I just went through trying to get my daughter into a great high school  but not the one she wanted   It was very difficult pushing her through tests and meetings with the school   When she had her final interview I told her that she was absolutely free to say that she didn t want to go    That s exactly what she did say  and so she isn t going to go 

No repercussions at all   Some parental disappointment  but that s ok  I m already over it   She works hard at school anyway and she is a good kid 

I m appalled by what your father did   That is absolute child abuse   I am so sorry "
191,"The open hand slaps hit way too close to home
Hope you re in a better safer place now"
192,You got hit in the vest with a 2x4 because your dad swung it at you 
193,When you say in the chest  were you being poked with a 2x4  or are we talking Hacksaw Jim use of 2x4 to the chest 
194, deleted 
195,My dad vaulted across the dining table and shoved corn into my sister s mouth until my mom had to do the heimlich on her  He never forced us to eat things again after my mom kicked him out for over two months 
196,I mean  I was not allowed to leave the table until I finished eating  but my mom would just sit me back if I stood up  Mostly we chit chatted while I took bout three hours to finish eating and she did whatever around the house from where she could see me and tell me to eat from time to time 
197,"One time my little brother wouldn t stop chewing with his mouth open  so my dad put his plate on the floor and made him eat off of it like a dog  This happened like 3 or 4 times  and he wouldn t stop chewing with his mouth open  He wouldn t eat off the floor  so he was basically just sent to bed without dinner  

It turns out my brother has a deviated septum and one of his nostrils is completely blocked  and the other is like partially obstructed  So it s actually really hard for him to breathe through his nose  which is why he was opening his mouth so much  My dad felt really bad when he found out    "
198,Naming the weapon used to abuse your children just seems so damn creepy to me idk why  Your dad sounds like a Mr  Pricko
199,Ah yes  child abuse 
200,"My cousin has her wooden spoon on her wall to remind her    Never again  She never beat her kids  but they know all about the wooden spoon  

Also had a similar experience with a friend    Except I was in vacation with them  We got caught smoking cigarettes  Her father beat the shit out of her with a belt  then locked us in separate rooms for three days  We were like 13    Jesus Christ  I forgot about that "
201,"   mom was soo angry  not particularly at me just in general which is more messed up  

I know that feel  My mom would often just scream and shout at me because people in her life were stressing her out  Like she d be talking to the utility company and they were being hard to handle so she d get frustrated and just start shouting at me  And being a kid  I had no idea that it wasn t  me  she was mad at  since I asked her to stop and she just kept going 

On the bright side  I can socially manhandle anybody who shouts and screams since I basically ignore it  Folks who do that aren t used to people just steamrolling them and dismissing whatever power they ve got 

   But it does mean my brain kinda shuts off when somebody shouts at me in anger  I just can t take them or what they re saying seriously and instinctively want to dismiss it and them as human beings "
202,"I definitely got wooden spoons broken over my ass several times    

I ll never touch my kids with one "
203,I think you mean  enhanced punishment techniques 
204,If I ever came home with a 80  test back in high school  my mom would have bought me a damn car
205,"Lol back when the Cubs were in the world series  some drunk cubs fans I knew had the idea to buy Buck Rags to break the  billy goat curse   

Legend has it that the cubs century long winless streak was due to kicking a man out of Wrigley Field over the stench of his billy goat  and he told them they d never win the world series because of it  So they wanted to prove they were willing to endure Billy Goat Stink for a cubs win   

They didn t last more than 30 seconds with that thing on their nose  I heard they puked everywhere 

What s so special about these rags that does that to people    "
206,"          what in the actual fuck

edit  my family owned goats as a kid  if you ve never smelled a buck in rut    it puts horny tomcats to fucking shame  it s a horrible smell "
207,"Thats fucking barbaric

Edit  Jo reddit  relax  i did not declare an upper limit on barbaric with this comment  I did not state that the other stuff in this thread is less bad  nor did I say that stuff like  throwing acid into a cheaters face  is not barbaric   Yes  some people give me shit with arguments like that 
Geez "
208,dedication and surely a life lession 
209,"I wish all the bad punishments here were more like that one 

Perfect use of discipline without abusing a power difference of an adult onto a child "
210,It s also a war crime 
211,I wish more people realized they can cut toxic people they re related to out of their lives  You can t pick your family but you can choose to leave 
212," Had friends whose parents forced them over fire with hot spices thrown in it 

Yeah I m pretty sure that was used a genuine military torture technique throughout history  What the fuck "
213,Yo what the actual fuck
214,I can understand the shock part  When I was 13  I was reenacting a fight scene from a movie with my younger brother who was 8 years younger than me  Yeah  really stupid   I ended up giving him a bruised lip  When Dad got back home from work  I was so scared and tried to explain to him how it was an accident  He slapped me across my face out of nowhere saying  how about this accident   Or something along those lines  I was in so much shock that I didn t even feel any pain until much later 
215,Damn  Did your parents ever apologize to you 
216,"As a parent this thread is making me livid 

I d better not find out any of my friends is abusing their kids "
217,Holy crap  Someone else with the same punishment I got  My parents were so sick of Star Wars I was banned from it for awhile 
218,Are you one of those people that like a song and listen to it constantly until you get sick of it 
219,I was friends with a girl in high school that had amazing handwriting  much better than my moms   She signed EVERYTHING I needed a parent s signature for  I m talking all 4 years  On the very rare occasions my mom would actually get to sign something was when I was accused of forging her signature  It s best to get someone else to do it because they wont be so nervous about it and the signature comes out more believable lol
220,You just went outside  That s all you did  What the absolute fuck 
221,I feel you on that  I was grounded for two straight years my sophomore and junior year because my grades were poor  they were poor because I was also getting abused  but abusive parents don t exactly connect the dots   Extremely restricted electronics use  no seeing my friends at all  That s probably why they don t talk to me anymore  They all got way closer with each other than they did with me because I couldn t participate in anything  Even in my senior year  when I was no longer grounded  they just didn t bother inviting me to anything because they were used to me not being able to go 
222,That s classic gaslighting mate  the worst part of my difficult childhood is prob the complete denial of any of it and the accusations that I m mentally ill for suggesting it  that can really fuck with you
223,Even though this is kinda harsh  this is the most reasonable punishment I ve seen yet  I m still kinda sorry for you OP
224,Exactly  Makes me wonder the mind set of the parents who does this 
225,Yep   It s sad that people think that physical damage will  correct  behavior
226," We don t talk 

Sounds about right"
227,That s a real different spin on pretending to be gay to get girls 
228,How ironic  they banned girls  but they dont want you to be gay
229,I don t think your parents know that boys change in front of each other and don t give a single shit about it 
230,i dont see that as a punishment  i see it as a win lol  awkward but still a win
231,I think you won
232,ahahaha  this is gold  This is so oldschool homophobic  you are allowed to bring a girl if it means you do not bring a boy 
233,Are you crazy  We re a church going family    Having girls over at your age is unacceptable  It says so right here in the Bible   Ooh    I think he s gay   Actually nevermind  Son  have you ever kissed a girl  It s pretty nice  you should try it  Here  have some girls  Lock them in your room  unsupervised  Your other parent and I are going to the store for 7 hours  you kids have fun  
234,Are we siblings  My parents like fought tooth and nail against me having girlfriends from like age 13 22   Now they re always wondering why I m not talking about my love life with them  wanting grandkids  etc   Puritanical views on relationships just end up backfiring on parents   It made me a good liar 
235,"I moved out because I was yelled at for getting a 70 on one assignment  I have all 90 s hundreds in that class and all my classes currently  He proclaimed that I was failing every class and that I have a 2 0 gpa  I have a 3 34 gpa    

Edit 
3 34 gpa is actually 3 33"
236,"That s one of those extremely stupid  reaons  to punish someone

Like if somene has quite good grades and drops by only one grade then the parents are getting mad and make extremely stupid punishments but if someone has absolutely horrible grades and doesn t even give a hoot to try make them better  nothing happens"
237,Bad parents are still bad parents  even if there s worse parents  Comparing suffering is stupid  because even if something is less severe  it will still affect a person strongly  So don t feel the need to stay quiet just because some people had worse parents than you 
238,I canceled Christmas once  My twins were 7 and woke up in the middle of the night and decided to have a sword fight  They took a chair and climbed onto the counter to get KITCHEN KNIVES  Picked the two biggest and went outside and stabbed the motherfucking air conditioner  I was so mad but more concerned  one could have killed the other one  I needed a huge punishment and don t believe in corporal punishment punishment  and that s the best I could come up with 
239," my mother was an addict

No surprises there  your grandparents sound like shit"
240,They sure can
241,That definitely caused your foot fetish  I have one too and also a thing for dominant women and if one  who isn t my mother  did that I d be in heaven
242,Don t be ashamed of it either  it s not your fault  and we know your not attracted to your mother s feet  just feet in general
243,My parents did this too when I was a kid  for weeks at a time  except they let me keep my mattress and a blanket  Even the decorations were taken off my walls  No stimulation except for homework  and once that was finished I just stared off into space or made imaginary stories in my head or slept 
244,Ohhhh those suck asssss especially when they get right under the ass cheeks where the thighs meet the butt  can t sit or stand 
245,"I feel you there  My experience with my journal being read wasn t as bad as this  though 

I kept my actual feelings in a little brown book in a dark recess of my desk in my bedroom  During the daily  search my entire room while I m away at school  check   which I was unaware of at the time was happening   they find it and read it back to front  They find a four year old entry about me feeling like shit and being a little suicidal  I think I said  it feels hopeless  or something 

They called the school  and had me pulled out to go home immediately  I had no idea what was going on besides  family emergency  

My father left work early on emergency leave  so they could have a two hour talk with me about  what s wrong with me   At the end  they were completely stuck in their own heads and weren t grooving with anything I said  which only reinforced the entire point of why I d written that 

Later on  after it cooled off  I destroyed my journal and began to keep it online  in my personal emails google drive storage 

A year  maybe less pass  then lo and behold they told Google that I was a minor  I was  however I was 16 17 at that point   and they forked over access and they mangled my folder structure just to find anything they can  have a talk  with me about 

They find the new and improved online journal and we have yet another family emergency and  talk about what s wrong with my head   

At this point I d been seeing a number of different  therapists  which were all mostly people who bothered me and or creeped me out  Some flat out lied to my face  All of them had a meeting with my parents after our chats and played them recordings   told them the play by play of what I said  That makes me think they weren t real therapists but I don t know the word 

I don t keep any kind of record anymore of how I feel for fear of literally anyone reading it and having a meltdown over it 

Hope things are better for you  stranger    "
246,Just because others had it worse than you dosent mean you didn t have it bad 
247,Thank God this ended so nicely
248,I m so sorry  I hope that you are in a safe environment now and feel safe 
249,"Had a similar experience except it was the day after  

I was around 17 years old  and my parents had caught me out that night drinking with friends  Unexpectedly  my dad woke me up at 7 00 the next morning and had me doing yard work until the sun set  Never once did he mention the night before  

Honestly I think he made the right decision  If you re going to drink  you still have to take care of the next day s responsibilities even if they are unexpected 

Edit  

Figured I d give a shoutout to my dad  The man had an alcoholic abusive step father that he grew up with who routinely punished him with some of the terrible methods in this thread  He s done everything in his power as a parent to help guide his kids in the right direction  He is one of the most fair minded and just people I ve ever come across  and it s clearly visible in how he dealt with my brother and me  I hope to be at least half of the man parent that he is "
250,I think this is the only punishment in this thread that satisfies the question and isn t straight up child abuse 
251,fantastic parenting haha
252,I would tell them honestly 
253,That s seriously fucked up mate  u doing ok now 
254,"I found a solution that seems to work with my kids  ages 2 and 4   

They don t have to eat their food   But treats and desserts and only for people who eat their dinner   parents included   There s a reason grown ups get fat   

We also have seen a rise in better eating behaviors since we started having them participate in making dinner   They get to peel carrots and potatoes  hold a pan while we spray it w  oil  and watch the timer to let us know when it s done   I think by participating  they feel less inclined to reject "
255,Holy fuck  
256,Thats horrific
257,Mooning a school bus is funny as shit  rip your PS controllers tho 
258,Calling your dad a wanker then pulling out and chomping on a bar of soap without breaking eye contact is quite a power move 
259,"I had a friend that when he cursed would get this by his mom  One day she just pushed him too far and he gets up and storms off  Comes back with a bar of soap in hand and yells  leave me the fuck alone   and shoves it in his own mouth still pissed off 

I was stunned "
260,Are you okay  Have you spoken to someone about this trauma 
261,Holy shite  that s probably the fricked up thing on this
262," It was mentally damaging etc

Yeh  that s really messed up  how are you doing now "
263,I d certainly like to hear more 
264,"Holy shit what the fuck


Asshole doesn t even BEGIN to cover what that «man» is

How are you now  That must be fucking traumatizing"
265,Oh my fucking God  If your mom saw it  or you have a scar  or any evidence at all  take that to court right fucking now  That s not even a punishment  That s just assault  Stabbing  strangling and beating are all punishable by law  Send that mother fucker straight to jail 
266,They do it in boot camp  too  Get out of line  Why don t you go mop that PT area in the rain

270,Now imagine what he would have done if you would had your pants up  I don t think that would have ended better 
271,Not gonna lie   this shit broke  made me laugh
272,He    He asked you    In front of your mom   That s just so indescribably irresponsible 
273,I cant evn imagine letting either of my kids  3 and 5  out of the house on their own 
274,"Honestly  I m fine  I m in my late 20s and lm doing really well 

I used to have bad episodes of PTSD and while I m still diagnosed with it  I can function  If you saw me on the street  you wouldn t even guess it 

Dad came back into my life and after he beat up my puppy  I haven t spoken a word to him  Puppy is fine by the way and is a huge dog now and he s afraid of him  

My sisters are sort of okay  The eldest has children of her own and is living well 

The second sister is crazy unfortunately 

She s narcissistic at best  We have a younger brother and he s autistic and unfortunately she s learned a lot of behaviour traits from our father  Though she doesn t hit him anymore  she and her verbal and mental abuse is still quite damaging  I m working to eventually be able to bring my brother to live with me in the future 

Our mother was also diagnosed with autism later in my teenage years  Her locking me away was her way of dealing with me  

I don t know if I can forgive her yet but I understand some of her actions "

282,Totally cool now  CPS and foster homes were great  Thanks for asking 
283,Five years for my father  eight years for my stepmother  Neither one got long enough if you ask me 
284,Believe it or not  but the courts thought it would be a good idea to return us to them after their release from prison  So it wasn t until I managed to get into college  thank you  GI Bill  that I finally managed to break away  Unfortunately my little brother never got away and ended up committing suicide on my parents property in 2006  After that  I don t ever want to hear from them again no matter what 
285,"My dad did this once to me when I called him a bastard    don t remember why I did that  probably blocked it out   My mom was home and stopped him  He didn t like it that I couldn t be his defenseless verbal punching bag that would just take it before   I hated when my mom went to church and my dad stayed home   He would dump about his problems  failures and shortcomings  many self induced  just his old man  for hours    and hours a day and he wouldn t let leave the room or go upstairs  It would end usually shortly before my mom would get home  I had to take medicine  obviously after moved out because my dad didn t  believe in Rx drugs and ADHD was  a myth    and therapy because I was such a cynical person being exposed to that shit at such a young age  I messaged my mom a few weeks ago and told her that after seeing the difference after I was on medicine  I realized my cynicism and told her he s a cynical person and I was going to rise above and break the cycle  

And be wonders why the fuck i moved out of state with my wife when she gave me a way out of there  Feel bad for my mom though "
286,I am terribly sorry for what you went through  Your stepdad is a piece of shit 
287,I had a similar experience with my mom when in was 10  I don t remember what I did to set her off  as a 10 year old it doesn t matter  I just remember her on top of me strangling me and screaming in my face that I was a little bitch 
288,Holy fuck

291,Just want you to know that you have no obligation to forgive your mother   You re a survivor and please continue to love the life you have now 
292,They always do that I m still to meet a mother that remember how she beat her kids
293,Is this gaslighting  My mother denies my father ever beat my ass with a belt yet I have memories that are clear as day 
294,Yah the easiest punishments are remembered while the harshest abuses are forgotten  I wont forget it  my sister won t either
295,"Just about everything in this thread is abuse 

I say this phrase enough for it to be depressing but punishment shouldn t be creative  Once you reach that point it stops being about discipline and more about being sadistic "
296,Damn  I m lucky  I was only ever spanked with a wooden spoon  and once I could outrun my mom  she let me  I can t believe people think beating the shit out of kids is good parenting

299,A girl I was babysitting had this  It was already super embarrassing for her  I couldnt imagine berating her for it  Im so sad for the original commenter  Nobody feels worse about it than the person it happened to  its just wrong to punish them for it 
300,Omg   TIL there s a name for what I probably had as a child 
301,My step kid has this  I had no idea it had a name 
302,Omg I did not know this was a thing  I would have accidents at home and in school until I was 6 I think  I am 22 now and I hardly remember any of the occurances but I remember feeling very embarrassed if it happened at school bc they had to call my mum or dad to come and get me from school early  The school probably blamed my parents and my parents blamed me but I couldn t help it  My parents bring it up frequently and I hate it when they do  I couldn t help it and them talking about it now just makes me feel terrible   
303,That s probably a little to close to the mark   
304,We have to believe you didn t intend that   
305,I saw it in a Law and Order episode  The kids had scars all over their legs and what appeared to be grains of rice embedded in their knees  Looked pretty brutal 
306,I m pretty sure I saw this one used as a torture in a movie set a Japanese POW camp 
307,My aunt used to make me hold a salty ice cube to my arm when I mis behaved
308,I m from a former communist country  Kneeling on walnut shells used to be a popular punishment at schools here 
309,I think they used dried peas
310,First grade  1984  Sister William Francis had this wooden pointer stick probably about as big around as a finger  If we got caught talking or misbehaving we had to put our hands on the desk palm side down and she d swing that fucking pointer down across our knuckles  Another nun would drag us out of church by the ear if we were making any noise  In junior high if you got caught walking in the grass it was an automatic 10 licks with the paddle  Catholic school was no joke 
311,I ended up marrying that boyfriend  We have a child now and another one on the way  My mom and I are on good terms after a lot of therapy

It s just setting up good foundations "
319,Geez  wtf is wrong with people  I had this problem until I was 7  and I got over it because my mother actually gave a shit and bothered to help me  They make a device you can wear to bed that wakes you up if it gets wet  It took maybe three months to train my body to wake me up instead of just peeing the bed 
320,Both
321,That s clearly sadism  It s a stupid punishment because it takes long and forces you to constantly watch to make sure they don t cheat  It only makes sense for sadist because they enjoy watching it and don t want it to be over fast

326,Thanks  All is good now  The best thing I did is moved out  I left home when I was 14  It s been a lot of years and I don t let it define me 
327,"It wasn t occasionally  
My parents slowed down the rate at which they spanked me and my siblings once my mom had hit my older sister so hard that she was covered in bruises  That s when they pulled the soap out  Soap is bearable imo  so they saved the vinegar for me  It was often enough that I vividly remember having to pull the vinegar out of the fridge myself over and over until it was easy to drink  At that point  grounding me was seemingly just as effective 

Edit  my three older siblings had permission to punish me with vinegar  so it happened far more often than it would have otherwise  It went from small capfuls entire to shots worth"
328,"That s what I told him  He felt bad even as he was doing it  but he said that he never lied  and when he made a promise he had to follow through on it

336,I can t imagine being your brother with those parents  Thank god you didn t tell about him in the bathroom later or who knows would ve happened

Healthy cause and effect  

The stories I m reading on here are 100  abuse torture and somewhat sadistic    It s hard to believe folks can grow up and be perfectly ok after enduring that  

Like     my kids lose tablets toys temporarily and gain chores  they re 7 and 3 5  like dish duty  wiping down bathrooms and sinks  vacuuming the rooms  etc  But damn     the kneeling on rice  spikes behind the heels  hands bound and getting your face and neck whipped with a belt  That s absolute torture "

14 15 years old  Came home drunk 

My mom was mad as hell screaming and crying  
Dad seemed fairly calm  

After I puked in the toilet a few times and sobered up some he just said  go to your room 


5AM the light came on in my room and he said  get up  take a shower and be ready to go in a half hour 

My dad was a roofer  In Florida  
And it was summer  

I spent the entire day hauling bundles of shingles and buckets of nails from one end of the worksite to the other  

I knew not to complain because whatever alternate punishment he was going to come up with was going to be worse 

He never said anything about my drinking that night  

Some years later I skipped school and went out on a boat with some friends  

Unbeknownst to me  dad happened to be out on his boat fishing  

We passed by him and he immediately yelled  get your ass over here 

I thought I was done for as we had beers in the boat too  

He made me get on his boat and cussed me out for skipping school and basically called all my friends a bunch of shitheads 

Then he made sure we had enough life jackets  a paddle and plenty of fuel and let us go with the warning  have your ass back home before dark 

He was a tough but fair man "

As far as how I m doing now  well this last week it s been rough    I m 24 now and this shit happen over here a decade and a half ago  This is the first time I ve really told anybody these stories and it s all over the internet  people I don t know  Living in a constant state of fear as a kid you learn to isolate and close yourself off  My girlfriend of two years knows I was abused but I ve never told her any of the stories  so this is a new experience for me and it s been difficult 

However overall I m doing pretty good I currently work as a CASA for abuse and neglected youth  As well as a behavioral specialist for kids with SEDs  severe emotional disturbances   Being able to relate to those kids and tell them that they re not alone is by far the most rewarding thing I ve ever done  And being able to hear their stories and tell them mine I feel helps both of us "

I m glad my daughter is honest  And she always tries to do the right thing  And when she makes a mistake or is having trouble containing herself  I know exactly how she feels and try to help her find a better way to work through it  Sometimes she has to face consequences  sure  but a paddle is not going to do anything but teach her to lie "

So anyway the blind patient was on a 1 1 and was taking a nap in their room  The staff had a laptop to do some charting while sitting on the 1 1  Well this staff member put the laptop on the floor  left the room all while neglecting to hook up any of the body or floor alarms  While the staff member was out of the room our patient got up from their bed and tripped over the laptop and face planted  Another staff noticed and we ran down to take vitals and make sure the patient was okay  Thank goodness the patient wasn t injured  but we were furious with our co worker for leaving  Their excuse was they needed to get some paperwork they had been putting off 


All in all this person didn t get fired  lord doesn t even know why  but did get a slap on the wrist  My co workers and I were  pissed   You do not leave a patient while on 1 1  even if they are asleep "

They both left work without telling anyone they were leaving to go to the same job interview  On the clock 

The job interview also happened to be for a job at a sister location for our office  And they both used our manager as a reference  

She got a phone call within minutes of their interviews  and collected their un stamped time cards before they even got back to the office  

She had them dead to rights for wage theft 

But it also took two months to fill any position at our organization because of crushing bureaucracy for job postings  And the lawn needed to be mowed before the weekend 

They both got to keep their jobs  They were still working there six months later when I left "

We called and asked for a new salesperson to be put on our account  Idiots  Inc  said no and that they would  speak  to Chad  Well  whatever they said just seemed to egg Chad on  It finally crossed the line from annoying to inappropriate  The whole thing culminated when he left a wildly inappropriate VOICE MAIL on her phone detailing all the things he d do to her if he got her alone 

The young woman was understandably freaked out about that and got HR involved  That was the final straw  and I think it was more because my company was afraid of being sued rather than worrying about their employee s well being and safety  ugh   

One of the female VPs called the owner of the company and played the message for him  The owner LAUGHED and said  Oh  c mon  boys will be boys     Well  the female VP made it her business to be sure that this company got not one more dime of our money  They were blacklisted and that was that   until this VP left the company about seven years later 

All of a sudden  we were doing business with them again  I reminded the COO about what happened  and he knew about it  don t kid yourself  and his response was basically  Well  enough time has passed  Neither employee is with their respective companies anymore and they provide a good service at a good price  so we re using them   Ugh  The OWNER was still the same POS and that would be enough for me to blacklist them forever   "

 She constantly says we shoups drop people from services because they can t be contacted and then when somebody else tries they get somebody the first time  Removing somebody from services and getting them back in can be a multi month process and if they were getting services they would lose them and maybe not be able to get them back  

During evaluations she screams pretty non stop when anything bad is pointed out"

Essentially he did some shady shit and actually fireable offences but HR decided to let him off with a warning  I think they quickly realised their mistake but they had already signed off on the first issues  so instead they tried to get him on anything they could and that ended up being  farting while working at a customer site "

10  Has cussed out and threatened our food and beverage director 
11  Has repeatedly given away drinks in exchange for cash under the table

And the one that really pissed me off and led to my finding out about the rest of these was a few weeks ago when he left in the middle of a shift to go get a haircut  was gone for over 2 hours  and when he came back  most likely cross faded based on his smell  he proceeded to hang out in the back while the rest of us worked  Outside  In Florida  In May  Wearing masks  gloves  and all black uniforms

We had a group that would visit our customers  give them advise  and keep them happy so that they keep buying our chemicals   We merged  so our accounts were split up with a new team  and we had this one guy who demanded that he get all of the accounts on the west coast   This is because his family lived there  but he lived in Houston  and was too cheap to visit   

We had a great customer  who are an oil major and therefore had great lawyers   They also were about 2 hours from his house so he decided he always needed to visit which was pointless because he didn t know what he was doing   One day he shows up with his wife  who is not an employee of our company and therefore doesn t comply with all the safety and NDA stuff   He drives up into this oil field   processing facility and leave his wife in the car without even the keys  because she can t drive        Security immediately wants to know who she is  and demand that he leaves   Instead he starts crying and tells a sob story  and ends up letting his wife stay in the waiting shack until he was done pissing off the customer again

I work for a car insurance company  We had an auto damage adjuster who was a bit of a legend  Some of the things he did 

  He once crashed a customer s car into a wall  We weren t supposed to drive the cars  He insisted he wasn t driving it and didn t know how it happened 

  He once sat down with the owner of one of our partnered body shops and told him that he didn t believe in the use of body filler  bondo   and all repairs for cars from our company had to be done without any body filler  Anyone who has done body repair knows that that is literally impossible  The shop owner had to call his boss to get him to knock it off  

  The same shop told this adjuster to take a base coat reduction for a repair  A base coat reduction is basically a discount that applies in certain situations where the shop is doing less work than what book time pays for  It s industry standard  and doesn t change the work that is actually being done  just the amount they are paid  The adjuster refused because  his morals wouldn t let him do it   The shop told him he s overpaying them and to take the discount  His supervisor told him he s overpaying them and to take the discount  He still protested

One of the worst instances I think I ever witnessed was in one of the preschool classrooms  I was like an administrative assistant and so would be in and out of classrooms throughout the day doing various assistant stuff  However  my education and experience are actually in infant  toddler  and preschool care 

I was walking through the 2 year old classroom and the teacher had all of the 2 year olds sitting completely still and silent on the rug as she delivered a  lesson   one of the many red flags of this school was that they expected preschool and elementary age children to be quiet and still 100  of the time  and flew into a rage if any of the children dared to act like a child   As I m walking through the classroom  one of the 2 year olds makes eye contact with me and smiles  I smile back and give him a little wave  He gives an adorable giggle 

Then  the teacher suddenly stops mid sentence and her eyes snap to this little boy  She yells   excuse me   What was that    The little boy is staring at her like a deer in the headlights  She then proceeds to  mock the little boy s laugh  in a way that let s just say mocked the way a person with an intellectual disability might speak  Her mocking tone was so full of genuine anger and hatred  and I was completely floored  I absolutely couldn t believe I was witnessing a teacher talk this way to 2 YEAR OLD CHILDREN 

That teacher still works there several years later  as does the entire staff of teachers  each of whom I witnessed verbally abusing children on multiple occasions 

I left shortly after  but not before writing them a scathing letter about all the horrible shit I watched them do to children  Fuck those people so hard  I will never forget how nice that school looked and how godawful it actually was "
667,My coworker cursed me out multiple times in the group chat and IRL  unprovoked   made racist jokes on the expense of others  our entire team consists of immigrants except him   made a comment about how i m only enrolled in college to be able to work student jobs and not because i m actually studying and while our bosses had it with his behavior  he was also aggressive with our costumers  and the constant bullying me and others had to endure they weren t able to fire him because of some stupid rules regarding student workers  I even had a weekly shift with him that they couldn t change because he refused to accommodate to others and there s literally nothing they could do until he finally quit by himself because he felt like he s too good for this job  More like time for his 33 year old self to recognize that he s a creepy dude who got off on bullying someone who s ten years younger  I m still resentful for how all my bosses agreed with what he was doing was wrong but couldn t actually step up to at least prevent me from being with him in a room alone 
668,"I used to work one of the three major shipping companies  orange and purple 

I would drive forklifts all day and handle heavy freight  Anything up to 3 000 lbs 

This includes hazardous material which we are all required to take haz mat training before operating a fork lift 

Oftentimes we would have to load hazardous material on the same trailer as foodstuffs  Depending of course on what kind ve material and the weight 

I saw a co worker damage a haz mat package with their forks  weighing 20 lbs ish   Instead of just admitting it to a supervisor  they have cameras on every single door we unload load fright into   The kid just picked the package up and chucked it back in the trailer "
669,worked with a mechanic who was a real dick  he didn t mark an oil pump on a Waukesha AT27 we were rebuilding  because it is an old marine engine they were designed to be able to turn in both directions  long story short  he built the oil pump backwards and when we ran the engine the first time instead of pumping oil it sucked it out of the galleries and into the sump   Ruined a  250k crankshaft  we fixed it  he built the pump wrong again and did the same thing a second time   he was promoted to shop foreman and 4 of 5 of us all quit

Was working at walmart years ago and we had some guy  who we ll call M  constantly harass women and objectify them  He tried to harass me a few times but I would have none of it and snapped quite violently  verbally  at him  which would always catch him off guard and luckily made him avoid me  but unfortunately it didn t run him off from other women  M was pulled into the office a lot due to complaints about him  but he never got fired  And EVERY time  no matter what  as soon as M would be out of there  he would go back to doing what he was known for  

He eventually quit on his own because he thought that  management was being raciest  for pulling the only black man that worked there into the office alot  

No  they weren t raciest  it was the fact that he kept harassing women  otherwise he was a good worker and got  most of  his work done "
679,"At a former job  one of the sales reps molested an executive assistant on multiple occasions and kept getting worse each time  

First it was just weird as he d follow her to the ladies room  wait for her to come out and then follow her back to her office  Then another time he d follow her to the ladies room  wait for her exit and grab her from behind when she came out holding her so she couldn t leave  Later at a company party  he again put his arms around her after a few drinks but then put his hand over her mouth when she started getting upset with him  Didn t see this next incident but I heard from a few people that he did a similar thing a few weeks later when she was leaving her office where he grabbed her  covered her mouth and carried her until she kicked him  The final incident was he asked if she could order some supplies and gave her a company credit to use card by placing it in her back pocket  stroking her as he did it and then grabbing her ass  She quit later that day 

When her boss found out about it and complained to the guy s manager in the sales department  the excuse was that a bunch of other sales people had quit in recent months and the department needed to maintain a minimum amount of people or their budget would be slashed  

The guy was eventually cut a few months later after the sales manager was fired and his replacement also replaced the entire sales department "

It was a mess  and the fact that they let him get away with everything and behave so inappropriately disturbed me to my core  I refused to go back once the summer was over  despite the camp director begging me  I couldn t stomach working for people who won t protect the children we ve been entrusted with  it was horrifying "

I believe the reason was a cover up to protect senior management   The amount of money for this system was considerable and required board approval   To have to tell the board that a  the deal was rigged and b  we paid more for the system than we should have for the system would have resulted in questions being asked that were touchy   I believe the lead engineer said he would go to the board if they fired him "

700,"Worked with a woman who regularly showed up a couple hours late  took smoke breaks every 45 minutes or so  and didn t actually produce any work  Worked in public service so firing someone takes years  She was erratic and often threatened people  Even after she told a coworker she was going to slit her boss s throat  it took another six months to get her out  

Worked with another woman who called in sick for several days about every month or so  but also in public sector so no repercussions other than people not liking her  One day she gets a travel advance  from the organization  to pay for a work trip a few days out  She spends the money then tells her boss she can t go on the trip because she can t afford it  She d spent the organization s money on rent or whatever  Rather than get her in trouble  the boss hands her his personal credit card to pay for her travel costs  She runs several non work related purchases on the card while on the trip and promises to pay him back  Now her boss is mad but takes her at her word  why  I don t know   Several pay periods go by and not a cent paid back  When confronted she has some excuse and says the boss actually owes HER money because she isn t paid enough  The boss finally takes the matter to the organization and the woman is accused of theft and gets fired just a few months before she would earn full retirement and pension

Our boss just says WTF is this  He immediately fesses up  except about the blow  then says he s a sex addict  he can t control himself and he needs help  He then explains that in the rush to fuck her he just pulled her panties to the side instead of removing them which resulted in a severe dick abrasion he felt required medical attention  

I drove the truck  and his GF  back  nothing happened to me at all  She did blow the whole way and was heavily flirting with me too  The guy did indeed go to the ER for cock burn  then he went to an inpatient facility for sex addiction for a few weeks  Got paid and everything  He started doing more coke and banging anything with a pulse the day he got back  He later went on to become a foreman there "

770,Yikes
771,All those women should have found dick pics on the internet and constantly spammed his inbox with them until he promised to stop 
772, What is the worst thing that you ve seen a coworker do   and still avoid being fired    
773,Bet he had to go talk to some nice people in white coats 
774,Not the same thing but I drunkenly sent a dick pic to my work group chat and I m still absolutely mortified till this day

777,I m sorry  eat weed and masturbate on the job   Like  don t you get embarrased doing that  
778,Do you mean edibles  Please don t tell me he was eating actual bud 
779,If at all at the same time it must have been impressive to see 
780,I ve read this as a list of instructions  will report back 
781,That sounds great  how do I apply 
782,Ha sounds like my old coworker  I worked at a dry cleaners  My coworker would go out to the parking lot and smoke weed  The smoke would get sucked into our hvac and people would return their freshly dry cleaned clothes for  smelling musty  Smoked the dankest weed I ve ever smelled  He never got fired  He was the owners son 
783,At the same time 
784,Aint work from home great

786,"  how mental illnesses aren t real and that autism was fake 

Hardly anyone around me knows that I m autistic so I d be really curious to their reaction  But I get along with them  based on you posting to this thread I assume they were more aggressive "
787,You expect someone to be fired for that 
788, Why don t you take a seat over there intensifies 
789,I was a nurse in the ED  and we had a patient come in after a nother  suicide attempt  This time she had taken an entire bottle of aspirin  When I was getting report from the nurse who was on night shift  she said that the previous nurse who did her admission hadn t checked any of her stuff and had left it all in the room with her   For those who don t know  that s a universal DON T   The patient had a sock full of razor blades in her jacket pocket 
790,You can get visual hallucinations if you re blind  That s pretty interesting 
791,"I ve done the psych thing a few times  and the thought of someone leaving a 1 1 fills me with terror for those patients  

BTW  got meds balanced and doing pretty good now "
792,I bet that staff member was thinking  well since this patient is blind  no one needs to know if I m just away for a moment    
793,As a former CNA I am CRINGING that they left a patient alone during a one on one  We would have been fired so fast our head would spin
794,That s not just worthy of being fired  that s 100  illegal
795,I love when karma is swift
796,Thank god for Karma
797,Karma    sure    
798,That  one  guy was able to make that mistake and cost you over a million dollars seems more like a management problem to me 
799,I imagine in other growing circumstances that would be punishable by death 
800,We had an IT guy that was stealing old laptops after we replaced them for employees with new ones   Funny thing was that we didn t give him a raise for five years since we knew about it  and apparently he didn t want to quit either out of fear of being discovered or due to the extra money he was making   His raise would have been worth more than the laptops so we just let it continue 
801,So many IT dudes do that  Part of the equipment cycle 
802,Maybe he picks up the extra shift Saturday work  the stuff bosses really care about 
803,Tons of these in every office I ve been in  but I bet if I did this I d be gone so fast 
804,You mean  Canary M  Burns  https   www youtube com watch v Mwpx0UckXys  
805,Brilliant
806,Who TF leaves a job on the clock and then uses that boss as a reference on an application for the same company   Man this has me laughing at how dumb they must both be 
807,A terroristic threat is still illegal  Why wouldn t you escalate this and notify the police 
808,Was the cyclist okay 
809,I would feel bad if it was a couple slices  something for dinner because they had no food  But a whole pizza AND pie  No more pity for you
810,For what it s worth  it could have been a medical condition  E g  someone suffering acute kidney failure has very low energy and sitting in meetings is the absolute worst  Another symptom is the loss of their body clock   insomnia  As a result they can fall asleep in minutes   
811,It sounds like she narcolepsy and she probably hasn t been fired because it s a disability and there d be a lawsuit on their hands 
812,A friend once told me that whenever she worked nights with a certain staff member  the patients were always really quiet  This was unusual as it was an acute  specialist ward and could be mayhem  She then discovered that the staff member used to just give all the patients unprescribed sleeping tablets when they were on nights  to keep them quiet   This was years ago and I don t know what came of it but fucking hell 
813,what is it with the schools here 
814,Her name was Tammy and I worked with her too apparently
815,How is there no criminal legal action taken against him  The FBI tends not to care whether you knew or not  as they should

819,So you re the problem then 
820,They either keep their job  move to a new department  or get a nice pension fund of at least  2 500 USD every month  Then they still may come back in a few years 
821,I might 
822,Why d you report them 
823,Snitch
824,Well  you shouldn t lose your job just because a cop feels like being an asshole  Maybe if you have warrants or are actually convicted  but not for getting drunk tanked because the cops swears they thought you were high 
825,It can be  and is  both 
826,We believe it was racially driven  I m not one to play the race card but I genuinely think that was it 
827,McDonald s
828,No  it was McDonald s  However  I ve worked for Walmart in AP and can confirm they do indeed hire meth heads 
829,Oh I tried  Believe me  as far as I was concerned he was a dead man  She begged me to put my pistol back  so after some hesitation  I did 
830, Twas but an oversight my dear 
831,"That is how it is supposed to work  People make mistakes   Different from the casual bastardry that is a lot of these replies 

When companies don t do what yours did  employee s just get better at hiding and blame shifting mistakes "
832,Barely  I had three days of  in my office now  I was honest  it was one of those jobs with more than one teams of two  and another guy was the lead  But as soon as I saw pictures of the devastation I knew it was my fault  I told my boss  that wasn t x s fault  I did that    I made a one in a million shot  I couldn t do it again if I tried  My boss said my honesty saved my job  But I m at two strikes right now 
833,A beat up camry 95  the Bentley was at the main house 
834,Three months
835,Bullshit walks  Manager didn t want to deal with the bullshit involved with a sexual harassment claim 
836,They were right to give you a warning  you are supposed to make a  noisy exit  from those conversations to cover your ass 
837,Management never wants to piss off their female coworkers  They walk on eggshells around them 
838,Management was his dad 
839,A business breaking the law  Color me surprised 
840,Mine was exactly the same as this except got he got fired for trying to steal from the company 
841,Well  OP did say under previous management that they weren t fired for it 
842,Hopefully one of them loves him
843,Yeah that s worse
844,Fun fact  goats can actually eat weed  Marijuana plants are not harmful to them 
845,I can just picture this  There s a meeting and your co worker is a goat  you do know my coworker is a goat right    Goat chews a can  
846,He had no shame or common sense  When some of his deeds were reported to the director  he threatened to sue for harassment and his boss had had enough and found another job  He still works there openly discussing which faculty members he would sleep with during staff meetings 
847,Highjacking
848,It was actual bud  Smoking it would have made it too obvious
849,Juuuuuicy Fried Chicken
850,that s ableistic discrimination  so yeah  harassment 
851,Are you being sarcastic   I would totally fire someone for that 
852,Obviously  It s very discriminatory to deny mental illness and the accommodations it requires  It also shows a serious lack of judgement and critical thinking 
853,You don t see a single thing wrong with any of that    
854,He was before Chris Hansen but that kind of sting 
855,God lord  I mean a lot of people would think that leaving them isn t a big deal  but we go through like 2 MONTHS of training at my job to learn all of the things you re supposed to and not supposed to do  Also you have to shadow another staff member for a month before you are able to be considered full staff on our units  It baffles me how many people just don t give a damn about rules 
856,My mom only has one eye  her brain fills in the stuff missing from her left side if she s in familiar places  but otherwise she tends to just see chocolate milk color on that side  When she first had her eye removed she would hallucinate aliens and little kids playing with a red ball on her left side 
857,Maybe they weren t always blind
858,It s got to be absolutely horrible from a liability point of view right  Like  with most patients  you can argue that you can t be everywhere at once  But with someone that you re supposed to be with round the clock for the express purpose of stopping something from happening if someone isn t there  you ve kinda lost the battle when you just aren t there 
859,AFAIK that isn t illegal   HIPPA only applies to healthcare professionals 
860,Swift and vicious 
861,I mean     😉
862,Yup  had a shop fire one for stealing phones  Dude had a pretty gravy job 
863,I only take home equipment we know for sure we can t use or won t use ever again  and cleared by bossman  I refurbish the units and donate them to those who need working computers  Saves them the cost of sending off to be recycled
864,"I worked with him for a long time  He was one of the people that would always bitch about his schedule and try to give shifts away  then would bitch about not having enough hours later  

And if he did want to work a shift  he would only work lobby  which was the only position in the restaurant that earned tips fast casual restaurant   He would always turn you down if you asked him to work your shift  

I remember asking him if he would work for me one night and he asked if it was lobby  I said no  and he told me to fuck off "
865,Frank Grimes gettin roasted on there too 
866,"I was completely sure they were both getting fired 

But the boss couldn t get by without at least one of them  and couldn t get rid of just one of them when they both did the exact same thing 

And yeah  They weren t the brightest bulbs themselves either "
867,Probably didn t think they d call the references immediately 
868,No idea  my coworker drove off   I tried to get him to stop but he refused  His dad is best friends with the boss so 
869,Nah  she was generally unpleasant to work with too but she never did anything that would be terrible enough to be fired  It was a unionized govt job  She would have to kill someone to get fired 
870,Yup  same here they gave them morphine or tramadol even though they sometimes didn t need them 
871,Funny  Tammy is Lisa right  Lisas are the bane of my brother s existence  Tammy is what Ron Swanson calls Lisas 
872,I m in Canada and boss didn t report it to any authorities 
873,I guess  Keep in mind the boss got pissed at me because 30  of my sick days were on a Monday or Friday and that was too many to be a coincidence  Upper management was kinda dumb 
874,The guy was the worlds biggest moron 
875,Omfg I never realized this bahahaha
876,I think your logic machine broke  you might need to get it repaired
877,"Because I don t want to take a demotion in order to get rid of a shit employee 

No  They didn t say  until they find someone new  or that they would need help filling her position in the meantime  It would have been a replacement  I did not get hired for that position "
878,Okay A  Don t jump to conclusions B  The guy had a warrant out for his arrest C  If you get arrested it shows you are irresponsible  you now caused your employer to miss out on a worker  one who didnt give you notice D  Your ignorance and prejudice against police officers does not have any impact of facts
879,You must be 15
880,"Playing the race cars is fun sometimes  though 

Also  racially driven would have been my second choice 

Edit  hey  you ninja edited your race cars comment  No fair "
881,Conservative  been called a bigot before  I m gonna go ahead and say you definitely keep the race card in your hand 
882,Typical Asians    Always causing trouble
883,Knew it had to be in food 
884,Should have at least called the cops 
885,Dont mind my new McLaren my dad bought it for me 
886,"Oh no doubt  Don t get me wrong  boss went into full ass covering mode with the client  notifying them of a vague error in our design  apologising   issuing a tweaked revision  just in case  And there was very much a  don t ever do that again  vibe surrounding the whole incident  But as you say  it was all done constructively  

We have since changed our filing process slightly so it is more difficult to inadvertently reference corporate jobs for details "
887,You should be proud of your integrity  Just keep applying yourself and you ll make it through life just fine 
888,That was almost very bad
889,Sorry  what do you mean by  noisy exit  
890,His dad liked the nudes

895,Wow   
896,The people showing lack of judgment and critical thinign and those who ve fallen hook line and sinker for the mass explosion in autism diagnoses over the past decade or two 
897,People are getting sick and tired of all these  high functioning  autistics demanding special treatment  It s so overdiagnosed now  There s so much statistical overlap now between autistic and non autistic cohorts that yeah  the guy is perfetly entitled to throw in his two cents   And to expect he be fired for it    sheesh  So precious    
898,But they were blind at the time they were admitted  when they were having the visions   
899,Yeah but the HR Rep still deserves to be sued
900,Statistically  assuming equal distribution of sick days during a Mon Friday work week  40  of them should have fallen on a Monday or Friday    how dumb was your boss 
901,If you glance at their comment history  not sure they ve ever had one of those  Just another run of the mill reddit idgit 
902,"A good supervisor will work with you  side by side if need be  if your boss thinks they re too good to do your job  What message does that send  

Tldr  Lead from the front  not the rear "
903,Then you re not worthy of your position imo  If they can afford to lose you I m sure your employer feels the same  I m sorry for you 
904,You must be white
905,The  boss  was black  If you were black  you got away with murder  If you were white  every little thing got you in trouble  My wife got screamed at over broken coffee pots  She didn t even work the night they got busted 
906,Hahah  I was convinced it was a japanese  shcoked to see it was an AfricanAmerican
907,At that time she still needed that job desperately  so did nothing at my wife s request 
908,Thanks  I hope so  People don t quit jobs they quit bosses 
909,Well now he s breaking into senior community trailer parks and raping them  So

913,Yes  but their brain still remembers visuals  and so can still generate them
914,Yup

916,Incredibly dumb 
917,"It s one thing for a boss to work with his subordinates  it s another thing for a boss to take a demotion just to fill a position

Back in the day  autism  used to mean something "
923,"Obviously we don t know the entire scope of the situation  but if an employer is willing to lose an employee to a lower position  they probably aren t an outstanding employee

Being of an age that I was filled with overconfidence in my own ability and a lack of concern for breaking bones  I decided that I could stand on top of the bollard and drop in on the kerb 

For some reason though  I didn t have the most sensible idea for getting atop the bollard  Rather than climbing onto it like a normal human being might  I thought a running jump was the way to go 

Towards the bollard I ran  skateboard in hand  and leaped through the air  My leading foot had the briefest of contact with the top of the bollard before continuing on past  my brain at this point remembering how momentum works and realising the error I had made

For some reason  though  I never told my parents that something was wrong  I think it was just embarrassment  both of what I was doing  and talking to them about what was going on down there  I was having a really hard time urinating  It felt like I always had to go  but I would sit on the toilet for what felt like hours and hardly anything would come out  

Anyways  while dealing with all of this  I took a bad fall in a basketball game and landed right on my stomach  smacking my nuts against the hardwood  The pain was nothing short of 7 10  I went straight to the bench and didn t go back in the game that night  I remember driving home with my dad and brother  and just whimpering in pain in the back seat  My right nut swelled to about the size of an oddly shaped peach  I missed about a week of school before things got back to normal  It got worse  though  

I don t know how long I was back in school for  but I remember things still being pretty tender down there  For some reason  I decided to get back on the court  This was a huge mistake  This time  my teammate passed me the ball  and my defender just ran up into me  kneeing me directly in the sweet spot  The crazy thing was  it didn t hurt  I got up  and was surprised that I felt alright  The other team was in foul trouble  so I went to the free throw line  I air balled it  And it wasn t short  it was about 3 feet to the left  It was then that I knew something was wrong 

I went to the bench in some sort of state of shock  I remember looking up at my dad  and the look he gave me helped me understand that there was something going on that my body wasn t aware of yet  It took about 15 minutes before I started to feel it  The game wasn t even at half time  but I remember standing up  walking over to my coach  saying there was something wrong and I had to go  I walked over to my dad  and we left and drove straight to the ER 

By the time we got there  my testicle was the size of a grapefruit  I don t remember much about the ER  but what I will never forget is the most tremendous pain I have ever  ever felt  It was a true 10 10  It felt like someone took one of those black binder clip things and just clamped it onto my nut  I was absolutely beside myself  I couldn t get comfortable  Any slight movement made the pain worse  but it hurt so much that I couldn t stay still  I remember that getting on all fours and letting it hang was the only relieving position I could find  When the doctor finally came to see me  it took everything I had just to lay down in the bed  As soon as I was settled  I felt the warm wash of morphine overtake me  and suddenly everything was 10x better   

I spent 10 days in the hospital  My testicle remained the size of a grapefruit for 6 days  I had a really shitty doctor  who basically said that we just needed to wait and let the swelling go down  My aunt  who was a nurse  ended up convincing my parents that we had to go to a different hospital to receive better care  The first day I got there  the first 10 minutes I spent with a doctor  they decided to remove it  I  went into surgery 6 hours after I got there  Almost a week of terrible  terrible pain could ve been avoided so easily  I spent 4 days recovering in the hospital  and another month or so at home after that  My initial doctor lost his license a few years later because of a similar situation with a different patient  

Apparently  whatever infection I had in my bladder spread to my epididymis and testicle after that first fall  The infection staying in there for as long as it did removed any chance of saving testicle  It was a really shitty thing  and I wish I had been a few years older  and a few years wiser when it happened  I had some insecurities in my youth that were hard to deal with after that 

Thanks  Dad  You re my hero "

About 7 years ago  or so   I was at home with my GF at the time  We had a fun relationship in terms of pranking each other and just giving each other shit pretty regularly and one of my favorite things was to surprise her with The Goat  Hiding behind corners so she d see it when she came around or doing it behind her while she cooked so when she d turn around  there would be my dangly balls and asshole  It was hilarious  So  one day  she s in the kitchen cooking something and I sneak in and drop trou  tuck back the boys  get in position  and wait  I m standing there for about 30 or 40 seconds when she finally turns around  notices  and starts yelling laughing  She starts trying to maneuver around the kitchen while keeping her back to me as I m trying my absolute damndest to goat walk and force myself into her eyesight  laughing the whole time  This is where the story takes a turn for the worst   

As I m half naked  goating around the kitchen  and tormenting my GF with my nuts  she grabs the dish towel off of the counter and threatens to towel snap me if I don t stop  I m not entirely sure why  but i didn t believe her    I REALLY should have believed her  So  I pushed her a little further and then it happened   like she summoned the powers of Indiana Jones  she cracked that towel whip and DEAD ON NAILED me right square in the taint like an assassin  I should have known it was coming  but it still surprised me and hurt like hell so I immediately jerked and stood straight up  The only problem was the fact that my nuts were still tucked back pretty deep  so not only did I get my taint slapped with a lightning bolt from Odin  but I yanked my entire ballsack down and smashed it between my legs when I jerked up straight  I dropped to the floor  completely unsure as to which pain was worse  and just curled into a ball while my GF fell on the floor and laughed harder than I ve ever seen anyone laugh in my entire life  Needless to say  that was the last time that I ever hit her with The Goat "

1121,My aunt has a great dane who was previously owned by a breeder  and I think he  the dog  was kept in small spaces or something like that  can t exactly remember  So he has not had a very good sense of space  My aunt said that when the dog was new to the household  he would keep bumping into her  if not knocking her over because he s such a big dog  When I went to their house  he had been there a while  so it wasn t as bad but a few times I got hit down there with that absolute tree branch of a tail 
1122,"My dog is super excitable  especially when going for walks  Sometimes he ll get really excited and start jumping up  Sometimes he jumps up at me because he wants to share the moment 

An important thing to note about my dog is that he s missing a leg  so his jumping game isn t very strong  It s strong enough  though  to bring his paws to level with my balls 

My dog fucking punches me in the nuts 

People find this hilarious "
1123,I had a dog  His tail was super hard if you were behind him  he d beat the shit out of you with it  When he is laying down  and someone starts calling his name you d think that a chapter book had been dropped from it s shelf

1142,"A classmate in highschool was riding his bicycle and trying to do some stunts  He was running up to this mound of dirt he wanted to jump  but the mound was so improvised and so shit that the front wheel of the bike got stuck at the very bottom instead of going up  having him slid from the seat and hit his crotch real hard  He told us that it hurt real bad  but he continued riding for a little while until it started to sting  He went home  got to check himself in the bathroom and saw that his balls were out of his sac  plus a little blood running down his legs  

We didn t understand what had happened to him  because somehow professors and school staff could not agree on an excuse to tell us why was he missing school  we were told that he had an accidente on a cab  but some were saying he was in the cab  others that he was hit by a cab  others that he had hurt his head  or broken a leg   Long story short  another classmate went to his house and was told by his brother that he was in the hospital because he had hurt his testicules  I got the full story when he came back to class  He was pretty laid back about it "

He confesses that he put rubbing alcohol in his bong  When he put the lighter to it  the whole thing went up in flames and exploded  He got to keep his junk  it just had to heal for a long while  My husband advised him to stick to joints in the future "

1343,Well normally when you hit yourself in such places its better to get it immediately checked for example if you hit your dick hard and it clicks or breaks its a medical emergency that if you dont fix can cause painful erections  erectile dysfunction  and other stuff which can be easily avoided by a trip to the ER  And if you say its still tender i think it would be in good sense if you had it checked by a urologist or a doctor that specializes in that area

1362,"My dad told me about his friend that went to the hospital after running full speed into the corner of a picnic table while trying to catch a far thrown frisbee  Right in the nuts  I can t recall perfectly  but he might have lost one  Needless to say  I haven t touched a frisbee since  

Also  the guy who threw it must have been a dick  Or bad at frisbee "
1363,For Christ sakes    I m bringing a belt sander to my office filing off those edges and applying foam bumpers for good measure  I actually gasped aloud when I read that 
1364,Well im glad that everyone is enjoying this   D
1365,Better than laddergoats  worse than stepstoolmules
1366,You are right  When I was in 4th 7th grade I rode horses too  I m a guy   Whenever I had correct seat posture my balls would feel like they were squeezed for 30 Minutes straight  So I after a while I just though  fuck this my balls are more important to me than this  so I figured out to what grade I could properly seat myself while not hurting my balls  Was not completely correct but kinda okay 
1367,I can chip in and say I ve done this too 
1368,Oh bollocks
1369,Menthol powder  if applied correctly  is dope tho 
1370,"Oh that actually makes a lot of sense xD

Oh god I never thought of it like that lol  I always saw it as a sandwich but it has eyes that only open when you aren t looking  Sneaky sandwich"
1371,muggles
1372,Testicles don t go into the body when it gets cold  The scrotum shrinks and the testicles gets closer to the body
1373,I just made an unholy snort noise trying not to laugh and wake my partner
1374,He s just lazy 
1375,doesn t everyone have one that hangs lower 
1376,My cremaster spasmed just thinking about that 
1377,But does that mean if he didnt smoke  youd just get the full smell of his toilet into your bathroom  I mean  I hate the smell of weed indoors  but I d definitely prefer that over the smell of someone else s straight shit
1378,Oh I would be hard at work trying to figure out how to glitter bomb his bathroom through the ventilation 
1379,I m by no means scared of them  I m just over them  The hundreds if not thousands of dollars a month in care  they are as fragile as glass anything can cripple or kill them  and their temperament is like a sour patch kid 
1380,This was many years ago   My cock and balls are doing just fine   The occasional tenderness is very mild and often non existant   My primary care doctor was not very concerned about it when it happened and we never discussed it again 
1381,r brandnewsentence
1382,Oh my  between this comment and the Larry long balls comment I m sitting here at me desk snorting  trying not to laugh  I think my boss noticed
1383,I was eating peanuts while reading this  and choked on them 
1384,Lmao
1385,I hurt my balls by tying them in a bow 
1386,That sounds like a really fun time 
1387,So soon it will be better to use my balls than my penis for sex got it
1388,Sounds    Sophisticated 
1389,It wasn t pleasant for him
1390,Perhaps I do
1391,Remember those Fruit Gusher commercials 
1392,An appropriate reaction
1393,He had to get it removed  There was nothing they could do for a  ruptured ball 
1394,Or both
1395,Oh thank god I m not alone 
1396,"  if applied correctly 

I assume this means not to the balls "
1397,youll never look at sandwiches the same again    thats my superpower
1398,but there s like this little area they can go boop into
1399,Yet imo its better to get checked by a specialist when sth happens cause primary care docs can miss things through no fault of their own  I mean afterall a specialist spends years studying just a group of specific organs 
1400,Maybe written  you know damn well they ve said it many times before 
1401,Is his name Larry 
1402,I m trying not to wake my partner who is asleep right next to me

1408,Did you try throwing them over your shoulder like a continental soldier 
1409,I need therapy just after imagining the pain
1410,I m deeply afraid now
1411,Like    It popped 
1412,They couldn t just form it back together with some bread crumbs like a meatball    s
1413,Can we never say  ruptured ball  ever again 
1414,I just folded my legs reading this   God damn it  
1415,Not really  Small amounts or powder with less menthol can keep you fresh and free of groin swamp

 You make me feel safe   for example  that s always awesome to hear "
1440," Your extensive knowledge of pre WWII aviation makes me feel all tingly  

 I wish I could find a man that knows about 1960 s muscle cars like you 

 I m so turned on by your encyclopedic knowledge of 1970 s progressive rock bands  

 No one knows more about guitar pedals than you  "

1457, Wow you re so big 
1458, You re really sweet  
1459,Me and my best friends have adopted complimenting each others dicks out of context   Sick dick bro   great dick dude  its hilarious and also just nice to hear 
1460,I enjoy the feeling of being desirable  Rather it s a look or just saying something that shows someone values you and they want to be close around you  Hell it even feels great when one of my dudes HMU wanting to kick it 
1461,Any kind  I think a lot of us men don t get compliments that often at all 
1462,Just something simple like   You re good  
1463,Any compliment
1464," You re attractive  

If a stranger were to say that to me  I would be flattered "

1467,You did well  my young apprentice 
1468,Nice boobs
1469, You re doing a good job 
1470, I feel you 
1471,Seeing as OP is replying personally to every comment  here s what I wish people would say more often   oh Azigol  you re such a great guy  I feel like I can trust you with my credit card number and the little digits on the back too  
1472,You re really witty 
1473, Good job  that looks great  
1474, In hindsight  I now understand that your lane changes saved us some time   Well done  
1475,I mean anything about how good my dick feels would mean I was having sex more often  so that d be ideal  But short of that  maybe that I m funny 
1476,I like your hair Well  by that I mean that I would rather not hear that it looks bad long 
1477,If you re asking what i often hear  then i got one  I consider you as a friend

I guess I gotta lose even more weight for that "

1484,Good work
1485,My voice

1487,"Its really the littlest things with us men   I ll admit im a hard ass and if you didn t know me   I come off as hard or an asshole  After all im 6 2ft tall  Bearded and bulky as fuck  With tattoos And the male equivalent of resting bitch face that my co workers call  resting murder face   But in reality  I just really want to hug someone  I really do want to cuddle all the damn time  One of my favorite compliments I ve ever received were about my eyes  But we are stuck in a world where if you are a guy  we are not allowed to ask for hugs  Or to hold or be held by someone  We don t get compliments like girls do  The most we get is  good job     it looks good   Etc  So yes  We really are starved for any form of attention or contact  
   Again  I m 6 2ft  Bearded  Tattooed  Look like I want to strangle you with your child s intestines just for looking in my direction  But a secret about me  Ive a pillow that I ve had since the age of 15 that I cuddle EVERY SINGLE NIGHT "
1488,Compliments  I ll settle for a genuine hello how are you 
1489,We both enjoyed that immensely  Is it okay if we bring some more friends with us next time 
1490,Just a general  I appreciate you  or a simple display of affection without it having to be necessarily sexual  Like ya know  letting me know you care about me would be nice 
1491, You re funny  here s gold 
1492,How great of a heart we have    even if we are creepy 90  of the time 
1493, You re not the ugliest I ve seen 
1494, You re not charging enough  your work is worth more than this 
1495, You re not fat  you re plus size  just like some females in this world

1501, No one can replace you 
1502, This is the best option available for me at this time  
1503, You don t look like complete dogshit  would be a break in the routine for my peers
1504,Your funny
1505,"I love your skin  

For context  I ve suffered with oily  dull  and acne plagued skin for years   1 1 2   2 years ago I got inspired by the 10 step Korean routine and my skin hasn t looked better  

Why are women the only ones sho get complements on their skin   😭"
1506, You look fine as hell  nothing better than a woman wanting you 
1507,A what 
1508,"Men generally like the same compliments as women do  We also like being told that we look good or we did something well or we are important  What needs to happen is men need to be complimented more often as a whole because we really don t get them very often  

The last truly sincere compliment I got was about a month ago when a friend admitted she thought I was scary at first but then I made her smile and we sang a song together and she realized I was a good person  Damn near made me cry"
1509,OP going through a bunch of these comments and complimenting people is the best part about this post
1510,Nothing makes a dude feel better than when his penis is complemented  Ladies  and some men   if  you re lucky enough to be chosen to see a man s hog  say something nice  It doesn t always have to be about size either  although those compliments are the best  It could be shape  color  firmness  For most guys very few see it so when you do  make it count 
1511, I love you 
1512,"funny answer   damn  you got a big ole dick and balls  

  x200B 

serious   I am happiest when i am with you  "
1513,I m not asking for compliments  i just wanna say that you re a great person for replying to everyone and making their day a little bit better 
1514,I like hearing that I m cute  pretty  beautiful  gorgeous  adorable  really all words that  unfortunately are not synonymous with men  Says something about me
1515,Literally anything because beggars can t be choosers
1516,"You look very alpha today  
Yea "
1517,You guys are getting compliments  
1518,Good job   Maybe a hug 
1519,A couple of people have told me that looking at me doesn t give a clue that I can write so well  I am a writer by profession  and I don t know how writers are supposed to look like 
1520, You re beautiful 
1521,Guys are like women when it comes to their bodies  its just opposite  Slender guys dont like being called skinny and that they need to gain weight or eat a cheeseburger  Where as alot of bigger girls dont like having their weight brought up  Also after you realize the comment is awkward dont say something like  I would love to be skinny because then it sounds patronizing 
1522,Compliment me on things I already feel about myself  Justification feels just as good if not better as  nice hair  or something  similar 
1523,People laughing at jokes you make is a great feeling 
1524,Ones that I hear outside my own mind
1525,Handsome boi
1526,Nice cock
1527,Nice dick  no homo tho
1528,That guy right there is a sexual tyrannosaurus 
1529, What a handsome scrotum  
1530," Damn dude      no body has been this nice to me       i m lucky to have you 
I just need little bit of appreciation man     "
1531,"That new barber you went to for you haircut    they did an awesome job   

Without laughing or going red"
1532,You re an amazing dad 
1533,Any kind of compliment with actual meaning to it  Like whenever you get a compliment from a family member or something saying you look handsome or you did a good job at something  it doesn t really affect you because they re your family and they have to compliment you  But when someone like your friend or even a stranger compliments on a specific thing that shows that they actually care  it really hits home dude   like them saying they like how your eyes look rather than you look  handsome  is so much more impactful because you know it s genuine cause they took the time to examine your face and concluded that they like that one feature  and they didn t have to tell you they liked that feature but they felt like they needed to  that feels good  But lazily saying that you generally look  good  doesn t feel as genuine because it s just summing up your appearance into a single word without taking a chance to admire any part of you at all 
1534, Have you been working out  
1535,"Acknowledgement of the progress I ve made is always the best compliment for me   

I used to be so shy I d have trouble speaking even to my friends  But a few months ago a coworker told me she was impressed that I was stepping up and taking a leadership role at work so much  It was nice to think how far I ve come   

 You ve grown some muscle  would be a nice one to hear  I m not buff  but I m definitely not the twig I used to be   

And if nothing else   I m proud of you  makes me feel all warm inside "
1536,I d say something like you make me feel so safe or this is why i like you
1537,I like you

1543,I m proud of you
1544, you were right     
1545,I d like a compliment on my mouth 
1546, Nice dick bro 
1547,Literally anything  Can t remember the last compliment I got that wasn t from my mother 
1548,What s a compliment 
1549, Wowwww  like  Cassie Ainsworth  https   youtu be uQ1S8 m1vD0 t 38  but while looking at my dick 
1550, Nice ass 
1551,I m not picky  any complement would be nice  I can t remember the last time I got one 
1552,TBH anything  Men don t usually compliment each other unless it s on their skills  The only time I can remember another man compliment another man me other than when dressed up for an occasion  saying we look sharp ect   was probably my outfitter  or grandfather 
1553,Good job
1554,Anything at all really 
1555, you re the best step brother ever 
1556,We ear so much that we are not usefull to the society  that we are violent and that we are all pedophile or sexual predator  For once i d like to ear someone tell me that i m not what they all say  that i am a nice person and that my life and those of other man truly are essential 
1557,I feel safe with you  always felt like its a very underrated comment  that means that a woman feels completely herself around you and knows that you will do anything to keep her safe  to me  it always felt like complete trust
1558, You re not a simp  you re a pimp  
1559,One that s genuinely honest
1560, You re the biggest I ve ever had  instead of  well  not being told that   
1561,Tbh just any one  I want to be loved  
1562,I like the way you drive
1563,"Damn  check out your side boob 

Great moves 

Keep it up 

   "
1564,  You make me feel comfortable   there is a certain amount of trust that comes with this  Not everyone is comfortable with just anyone 
1565,honestly  a simple  not bad  would be a massive improvement to the deafening silence im currently receiving 
1566,Any compliment would do 
1567,I would like to hear compliments in general  nothing specific just nice to hear them when they come around every 5 years or so
1568,Nice cock
1569," I love how loyal you are  

I am loyal to any of my closest friends  almost to a fault  Some just don t pay enough attention 

 Your extensive knowledge of anything wrestling isn t nerdy  it s actually pretty cool  

I am a huge fan of wrestling  have been since 2003  I d rather people compliment me on it than say shit like  you know it s fake right 

 I wish I knew more people like you  

Dudes  I d fucking love to hear that "
1570, Nice cock bro  
1571, Nice cock 
1572," You re actually really tall

1574, You treat your S O with such genuine affection and respect  It s a positive example for others  
1575, You deserve money  please take some  
1576, You re funny   Most guys want to be the funniest guy in the room 
1577,"I am confident enough  so I don t really need the validation  Although pointing out I look good is always an ego booster 

Edit  honestly I rather give compliments  because I love the feeling when you see that your compliment gave the other person a good feeling "
1578,Any of them 
1579,What s a compliment  
1580,I appreciate you as a person  
1581,I totes appreciate you dude 
1582,She didn t have to say it  but the first time my GF stayed at my house for the night she fell asleep on me within minutes of going to bed and she slept the whole night without being disturbed at all  I only know this because I was up most of the night as this was the first time someone had shared a bed with me in probably seven years 
1583,You make whoever you re with feel safe 
1584,Can confirm when GF says this it may Blair my ego but it s also sweet
1585,I ve got this a few times  I still remember one of the girls that I share classes with at uni told me this while we were on our train ride home  Context is we ve seen each other a few times already around uni but this one time of my mates introduced us to each other as she s friends with her  On the shuttle bus she realised that we lived in the same the area and my mate suggested we should catch the train together so we did  It was at night and she told me halfway that she feels comfortable and safe with me sitting next to each other comparing with other of her guy mates  I was surprised since we pretty much just met each other early that day and that felt good hahaha  Still feel good even after all these years
1586,Wow  such extensive knowledge 
1587,Given your username I would suggest you also have extensive knowledge of post WWII military aviation   
1588,I d definitely love to listen to all your knowledge about 60 s muscle cars 
1589,Dude  progressive rock is  the shit   it s an awesome genre 
1590,"   I m so turned on by your encyclopedic knowledge of 1970 s progressive rock bands   

I have definitely said this before  It s a compliment in the highest regard "
1591,These are all things my college daughter would appreciate in a guy 
1592,Knowledge really is attractive   Especially passion for really niche subject  because it shows that you dedicate yourself to what you re interested in   So props to you 
1593,Please talk WWII aviation with me  I used to love that show dog fights on the history channel  I always wanted to be a pilot 
1594,Dude  I can tell you an actually interesting girl would love that  If she doesn t love history  mechanics  and or music  and she doesn t have the excuse of being into literature and language or some form of art  she s probably just into cosmetics and clothes and nothing could be more draining for your interests and energy  Girls into cosmetics and stuff have their own style and way to go  and it s not even a little bit a bad thing  one of my best friends is a genius with makeup and she has taught me all I know   but trust me when I say girls exist who love what you love  In fact  after all that  I can genuinely say as a history buff and a musician  it s awesome that you know that stuff so well  😁
1595,What do you think of the band Can 
1596,Oooo  tell me more about the Colony of Slippermen 
1597,Thoughts on the wampler pinnacle deluxe V2 
1598,I ve got a buddy of mine who this describes perfectly and if I were trapped in a woman s body this stuff would turn me on 
1599,As a history student and a prog fan I really feel this
1600,"I m no lady but we could certainly be bros    
   
You might school me on pre WWII aviation but WWII era aviation I ve got on lockdown   Everything else you mentioned is my shiz "
1601,She wants to see the Eindecker
1602,For me it would be  Your passion for dirigibles and rigid lighter than air craft is inspiring 
1603,Sounds like someone I would like to sit down and have a beer with 
1604,Girthy knowledge
1605,What is your favorite aircraft made by Martin  
1606,Hey baby  you wanna take a drive in my mustangs  yes both of them

1612,Nice Liebherr Lr 11000 Crawler Crane
1613,One of my old coworkers came into work dressed up for his birthday  I told him he was looking sharp  and I swear I ve never seen him so happy lol  Made me smile 
1614,"I once told a distant coworker  he didn t work in the same department    going through a divorce  oh I m so sorry  well you re so handsome  women are going to flock to you   
He came back days later to thank me because  it meant so much to him  he s never gotten a compliment about his looks before and it helped his self esteem to hear that  which is wild because he was actually handsome and what the heck his  ex  wife never told him  "
1615,You looking mighty fine today 
1616,Why aren t you looking so fine that other people will be day dreaming about you in the next 5 4 3 2 umm

1620,Nice ass
1621,I heard this once from a stranger like 5 years ago and it still makes me smile when I remember it
1622,I once got  nice arse  for a fat guy   Backhanded compliment  Perhaps  but I ll take it 
1623,Or the 1980 s version of that which is  cute tushy  
1624,Can confirm men like this  First time I ever flirted with my  now  boyfriend  he walked past me  I called out to him and told him to turn around because his ass looked great in those jeans and he got incredibly flustered  Still does when I compliment him on it even though we ve been dating a long time 
1625,"there was a time when I was in an English class  stood up and from across the class  someone said  I d kill for your ass   Simultaneously the most gratifying and embarrassing thing anyone s ever said to me 




edit   grammar"
1626,You have a great arse  my good sir 
1627,"I ve had this happen a few times  I ll be out and find myself focusing intently on a guy s ass  He ll turn confront me about looking at his girl s ass  Then I ll say  I actually wasn t looking at her at all  I didn t even realize she was standing there  I was looking at yours the whole time  It s really nice  

Fortunately no one s gotten upset  The guy usually just says  oh  Uh  Wow  Thanks  "
1628,I m sure that special someone is lucky to have you

1635,They will go away eventually  I had terrible acne for all of high school and now I rarely get a pimple  Keep your head up king 
1636,Coming from a woman  I personally never notice acne  It never bothers me and I ve been attracted to guys with acne  So don t worry about it too much 
1637,You re intelligence is the brightest   Who cares about those zits   They dont make you any less intelligent

1642,"For me  I have a bad case of rejecting compliments  

  "
1643,I ve wondered how a guy would feel if a girl told him he was beautiful  cause there have been times when I ve seen a guy and thought  that is a beautiful man 
1644,You are so beautiful 
1645,I appreciate that you acknowledge this as a compliment  I tell my SO this and I m not sure if he enjoys it or not  He hasn t said anything about disliking it but I hope it makes him feel good   
1646,You ve got lovely chest    hair   That was hard for me to do but you deserve it 
1647,All I hear is  Shave that taco meat off your chest

1650,You better go full Austin Powers at least once in your life  big bro
1651,Man I wish I had chest hair you should be proud of yours   
1652,When one of my exes first started dating  it might have been the 3rd or 4th date and she began stroking my arm while we were watching a movie and asked if the rest of my body was that hairy  I said yes  She then  felt up  my very hairy chest stomach  I don t think she arrived with the plan of sexing me that night lol   Some dig the hairy man 
1653,As a woman I love chest hair on men   I think it s cute  same with booty hair 
1654,I love chest hair on a man  i like running my fingers through it when lying down  It s both comforting and sexy  Own that chest hair 
1655,"Chest hair is awesome  I m not a huge fan of the super puffy kind  but that s easily trimmed into a more manageable pelt  

I would say my preference FOR it changes in my very early 20 s "
1656,I like chest hair  We exist  I think a lot of men would look weird without it  actually   I also like lack of chest hair when it fits the guy properly  Basically  it s whatever is right for the person 
1657,Nobody cuts grass better than you  
1658,Lawnmowers unite
1659,Your hairline looks great the way it is 
1660, Feels 
1661,As a 24 year old that decided to shave his head last year due to this I feel you 
1662,Science  please   After you figure out the coronavirus  and okay  cancer I guess  Please fix my hairline 
1663,Your complexion is beautiful 
1664,Anyone held in your arms is bound to feel safe and secure with you 
1665,You do matter   You are a special person who deserves good things  
1666,I m really proud of you  
1667,Honestly hearing that from my parents makes me just hurt inside because I truly think their pride is misplaced
1668," Most of the time we don t care about physical compliments 

I completely disagree with this tbh "
1669,Yeah that s sounds so much better than being complemented on a physical part of yourself 
1670,You are strong and wise  and I am very proud of you
1671,"I took on the responsibility of taking home a two week old kitten I found at work that had been abandoned by his mother without knowing what I was getting myself into  

When my little Jack was about 9 months old my mom  who I cannot recall her ever complimenting me my entire life  told me she was so proud of me for being able raise a kitten from such a young age  

If I hadn t been driving I would have started to cry "
1672,I hate  I m proud of you    It s so demeaning  It s like you re some little kid that has finally learned how to stop shitting your pants 
1673,I read this story once were this guy was getting intimate with someone and they said   my body loves you  and he said it gave him more confidence 
1674,I could see this kinda turning me off if it doesn t seem genuine  You know if you re big or not
1675,I had a woman say that to me during sex once and it just made me cringe  Like  I know my dick is average size and that doesn t bother me in the slightest  I don t need you to try and flatter me 
1676,A well acted  ouch  during a deep stroke can work wonders  tbh 
1677,  
1678,You are the sweetest person ever imaginable 
1679,"This  but not facetious   As is typical like 99  of the time  


In fact I d go as far as to say  You re really sweet  or  You re so sweet  is probably the one  compliment   most  men have heard  which figures because it s hardly ever loaded with any real sincerity "
1680,Isn t this what girls say to guys when they turn the guys down   You re really sweet  but I don t think so  
1681,I ve heard this enough times to dread it   You re so sweet but I m gonna go with this asshole who treats me like shit   Took me a long time before I figured out how not to always be the nice guy 
1682,That sounds awesome 
1683,I stare creepily longingly at my husband s peen when he takes his pants off  Does that count 
1684,You have the most desirable traits that anyone could ask for

1697,Your feelings are valid 
1698,I feel like I could trust you with my credit card number but it s maxed out right now honey   Wouldn t really do you any good   How about we hang out and watch Avatar On Netflix or I could totally destroy you in Smash Brothers   Whatever you want  BAE

1735,"as long as you aren t overweight in a way that is very unhealthy  I don t care about what a guy looks like

actually  the first person I had a crush on was a little on the plus size  but I didn t care  because what made me like him was he had went out of his way to help me  I am still acquaintances with him  and he has a girlfriend who happens to be one of the more  popular  girls in school  When she first told me she liked him I thought it was adorable and as far as I know  they went to the last school dance together  

So stay stong "
1736,You are so appreciated  even more than you think you might be   Keep being awesome

1776,My first long term gf spent the night at my house one time while we were still in highschool  We slept on my horrible old couch  and my back hurt for a couple days after  but that was the first time I d ever spent the night with a girl  She slept soundly in my arms and was just enamored with her  Her breathing  the slow rhythm of her heart beat  the way her head rested so easily on my chest  I feel it
1777,Reading this makes me feel like I can t die   I m in the living room 
1778,Wow everyone is decent here   I was gonna say that s biggest package I ve ever seen  but she has to mean it
1779,What do you consider progressive rock 
1780,I d be wary of accepting a compliment based on your username
1781,Dude   
1782, I like your nostrils  lmao and WTF is bifid 
1783,I m continually surprised by just how many men are never complimented on their appearance by their partners  My current boyfriend has told me he s never been complimented on his body by a girlfriend before  which is just    Ridiculous to me  I m trying to encourage my female friends to compliment their male partners more often  Everyone deserve to feel like their SO is attracted to them 
1784,Good on you  It s really weird isn t it  The girl I just stopped seeing never complimented me once  Well except one time when she thought I sent to the gym and she said she was proud of me lol
1785,Thanks
1786,Oh yeah   real  nice  asshole 
1787,lmao
1788,You could hear  Nice asshole  depending on the subreddit you post on    
1789,Do you also have prosthetic butt cheeks 
1790,this is a blessing in disguise because whenever your grill runs low on propane  or propane accessories  you ll know where to turn
1791,Do you also have a narrow urethra 
1792,Thanks 
1793,Nice ass
1794,I once got  pretty fly for a white guy  on CD if that counts
1795,my grandma was the undisputed king of back handed compliments  wow that shirt is nice  it doesn t make you look nearly as fat as the rest of them do  that was the closest you would get to  you look nice today

1802,I m a fan of fruity smells  so I mostly focus on fruity shampoos or deodorants 
1803,Idk  you wouldn t really know me enough to be able to judge wether I d be awesome
1804,Thanks I hate chest hair 
1805,"Chest hair is SUPER hot  My husband shaved his before we got together and I made him stop 

Edit  the  made  sounds weird and controlling  it s more accurate to say I  encouraged  him to stop lol"
1806,I bet it does  its the receding that he is worried about  lol 
1807,You probably look great with a shaved head tbh   My dad and his uncle both have horrible receding hairlines and decided to do a short buzz cut and it looks great on them 
1808,Bald is beautiful too dude   Plus young bald guys look super badass
1809,Ɛ 
1810,"I agree  I have been genuinely complimented on my physical appearance 4 times in my life  And I remember every single one of them  

Thank you drunk girl in the bar  gay guy on the subway  female friend  and a gay guy on the street  

I think it s context  whatever we personally needed the most stands out  OP is probably a decent looking dude that gets hit on frequently enough "
1811,yeah the girl saying  my body loves you  is one thing  but what if the girl s abdomen just said  I love you  directly and cut the middleman  middlewoman   entirely
1812,What if a girl says  you re the best sex I ve ever had 
1813,Actually  a lot of men have a very warped idea of whether they are big or average or below average  Likely has a lot to do with the fact that most of erect penises men see are in porn  and most of those are either larger than average  and or shot at flattering angles or with tiny partners  If you haven t measured and looked up stats  you might be way off as to where you fall on the scale 
1814,Depends on your age  I genuinely didn t know I was big until my early 20s after I d been with enough girls who knew enough to say it 
1815,was she like  ow  or  HOLY FUCKING SHIT YOURE SPLITTING ME DOWN THE MIDDLE 
1816,Maybe she was with guys significantly smaller  so to her  you re huge   
1817,She might just have a smaller than average vagina  making your average size feel huge 
1818,I tried this and around the third stroke on hole 4 my dad asked if I was arthritic or something with all that pain and I had to tell him no  I was just saying it because it s supposed to help with my golf game but he didn t understand
1819,Thank you so much    
1820,Being called a nice guy is kind of the worst
1821,I like how you re giving everyone the compliments they ask for but with this one you re like  Yeah I m not touching that one  XD
1822,Hey  great dick my man 
1823,Sometimes actions are enough  but if  you tossed in a   heh  nice dick man   couldn t hurt

1839,I hear that compliment quite often after I tell a girl I like her 
1840,Yeap  that s approved  Anything on those lines  we re it ll make the guy feel wanted it s the best feeling ever

1845,Oo someone needs belly rubs 
1846,Thanks brah
1847,Thanks man

My personal favorite is Yes  followed closely by Genesis"
1852,Oh
1853,The screen name tho   
1854,It s like making a cleft to divide something into two but not completely  Like a snake s forked tongue 
1855,It blows my mind that women like that exist  I make sure my husband knows that I think he s still sexy AF to me after 13 years together and 8 married 
1856,I ve been with my wife for 10 years now so you d think her compliments on how I look wouldn t have the same  punch  by now  Nope  I still get all warm and fuzzy when she compliments me on how I look  It never gets old
1857,I get that a lot
1858,It s a medical device 
1859,Now send a pic
1860,I really appreciate that  thank you man
1861,A woman at work once said it to me  woman s lib type    I said back to her   Geez  that sounds like sexual harassment in the workplace    I d never seen someone turn so red  It didn t really mean anything because we were friends and I took it as a joke  but three weeks later she gave me a blowjob in the server room   Not that the two events were necessarily connected  Or were they

1873,Haha not as enthusiastic as that  It was more like  oh  you re so big   Kind of like the fake acting in porn videos 
1874,I had that happen only once but it s cuz she was like a vice grip  Anyway  she was crazy too  She preferred guys that were smaller than average cuz it hurt her  Or so she said to get out of a relationship with me or make me feel better  I don t know  It s been 10 years and I m working through her damage
1875,Well one of her proudest achievements was that she d slept with nearly thirty blokes by the time she was 18    so she must ve had some shit luck if they all had tiny dicks 
1876,after really deep strokes i have to ice my elbow  my girlfriend gets all like  you swore this wouldnt happen again youd take it easy  and then i make her put an elaborate athletic tape get up on my arm  Then I dont vacuum or dishwash or take the garbage out for a week because well im injured  good times

1907,Lmao interesting thing to be proud of 
1908,You are an amazing person
1909,IDK how many other girls are like this  but personally  I am only attracted to someone after we become friends  Not because I don t find them physically attractive  but personally  I don t care what a guy looks like  I want someone who can be my friend  What I find attractive is a guy s personality

1931,Ikr like even with stay at home orders in place you learn something new everyday
1932,"When my mom died  I was pretty destroyed  We were very close  I was feeling like I couldn t understand how to live in the world without her  One day I was driving home from work  depressed as hell  and I started thinking how much I d love it if I could get a sign from her   surprising myself a bit  as I m not at all religious  and am highly skeptical about things like signs from the universe  But I missed her so much that I mentally asked the universe for a sign  

She really loved birds  so I thought  wouldn t it be cool if it came in the form of a bird  Maybe a sparrow or even a pigeon or something 

I got home  parked my car  and walked up the path to the cottage I was renting  this was in the city of Berkeley  CA   As I was unlocking the front door  off to the side a flash of color caught my eye  I turned to look  and it was a Chinese pheasant  I had no idea what it was  I had to look it up  but if you Google Chinese pheasants  you ll see why I was so blown away  It was brilliantly colored  with gold on its head and back  orange and black bars on its neck  bright red chest and blue on its wings   the most psychedelic bird I ve ever seen  And it was standing on my front porch  a bird native to fucking China  I had no clue how the hell it COULD even be there  I thought I had to be dreaming  so I got my neighbor to come see it  We stared at it with our jaws hanging open  Then it sort of squawked and flew away 

And it hit me  that I had asked my mom   the universe for a sign  thinking maybe a drab little sparrow or a pigeon   and what I got was a bird that was ridiculously over the top  and it was exactly the kind of joke my mom would have loved  

I m still skeptical and not religious and don t believe in fairies and shit  but    that was weird  and also great "
1933,"I was in the depths of despair  I had lost my great job  had to travel 2hrs everyday with heavy tools each way to a temporary job I was doing  Sitting on the bus  thinking my world was over and it all kind of got to me all at once and I began to tear up  not wanting to ball my eyes out in public I held it in  So I asked for something anything that could show me that life wasn t worthless  

A lady I didn t see must have how bad I was or maybe it was just coincidence but just after I cried out in my head  I heard the words   Everything is going to be ok 

It saved my life 

Edit  I had no idea that this would affect you all so much  Sometimes it might be dark and a small spark starts a fire  Sometimes you re the small spark  

Be the change you want to see in the world  

Thank you for the awards too  I can now give awards to others "
1934,I was walking  What would have been a 4 hour drive    And I was walking  I straight up begged for a car to stop and pick me up and literally seconds later a woman stopped who was traveling all the way to where I was heading  Same town  4 hours away  What are those odds 
1935,"I m not superstitious at all  but my uncle is  When my Nan passed he went to see a fortune teller who told him that anytime our family sees white feathers around  that s Nans way of showing us that she s there  I thought it was a load of bullshit and forgot about it  

A few years later I was at a music festival  Everything was coated in dirt and dust being churned up by thousands of people s feet  Even the air was so thick with dust it was making it hard to see and breathe  I was on the edges of the mosh pit when I started to have my first panic attack  I d never had one before  didn t know what was happening to me and I was terrified  I felt like I was being crushed and like I was the only person in the world at the same time  I remember desperately thinking  I don t want to be alone  I don t want to be here alone  I crouched down in the middle of the dirty dusty crown and when I opened my eyes there was a single white feather on the ground right between my feet  It was perfectly white  no dirt  not stepped on or anything  in a mosh pit  I stared at the feather until I could get my breathing under control and get out of there and I still have that feather "
1936,"This wasn t really asking for a  sign   but I was going through a lot and in a really shitty and dark place  like the kind of place I honestly wasn t sure I d survive  I was teetering on the edge of despair and genuinely going down the path towards doing something insanely drastic  I basically just asked the universe for help one day while in the middle of another crying episode and I had this strange  sunny feeling kind of leak into the darkness I was harboring inside of me 

The next day  by chance  I met my group of friends on a video game I played regularly at the time  They lived in an entirely different city and had entirely different lives from me but we all just    clicked  It took a month or two for me to settle into that friendship and understand that they were gonna stick around  and they ve been my best friends for three years now  Some of my best memories are from that first summer that I knew them 

I genuinely don t think I would have survived that time in my life had I not met them  I was feeling incredibly alone and I was trying to come to terms with a lot of things all at once  I m infinitely grateful for them  and I can t help but think that the universe was listening that day when  as a last ditch effort  I asked it for help "
1937,"I really don t like my job  and I ve been daydreaming about what I could do  I just needed a place to be able to do it 

The next day I get offered to house sit for a couple years in this big Japanese house that has a storefront in the front  There s a perfect space to do what I would want to do  I would live rent free and be able to save up to buy my own business visa here  I wouldn t need to work in this job any more    "
1938,"All my life  whenever I went to the beach I had wanted to find an intact sand dollar  I had found lots of pieces  but never a whole one    

When I was in my mid 30s  I went with a group of friends to the coast  I was walking alone along the beach in the moonlight close to midnight  I was feeling very sorry for myself in the dark  and really lonely  even though I was with my friends that weekend    

I had just started thinking the thought   Wouldn t it be a great sign right now to know that I m loved if I finally found a sand dollar   I had barely formed the thought when I looked down  and right at my feet was an intact sand dollar "
1939,"I asked if I should bother sending a text to my abusive ex  My phone responded by discharging all of its electricity through the charger port and refusing to turn back on 

EDIT  I feel as though I should clarify this since there s been a bit of confusion  I m a dude  The abuser was my ex girlfriend  So  yeah  sadly that shit happens to guys too  But I was lucky to have supportive friends and family that helped me to get the hell away from her  and now I know what signs to look for and what lines don t get crossed  Actually just got out of the healthiest relationship of my life  and though I m quite sad about it ending  at least I know now how to find a good person to be vulnerable with "

1941,"I was 18 years old  recently graduated from high school and basically being forced to attend cosmetology school by my stepmom  while also working a full time job  I was exhausted all the time  My stepmom and I were very religious for a long time but I was starting to question my faith and stopped making church a priority  This caused a lot of drama  and I think resentment  from her and my father who worked out of the country  

While attending cosmetology school I had made friends and was so starved for any sort of friendship and I guess even affection I would tell them the things I hated about my home life  They helped me start to see how toxic my parents and situation was  I knew I had to move out 
I tried to do so amicably but to no avail  In fact my attempts to leave peacefully backfired and caused more problems  

At the time  being religous  I prayed for a way out  But my prayers rarely were answered so I grew hopeless  A few weeks later after a rough few days between me and my stepmom things came to a head one night and she called my father  

They had threanted for years to kick me out    I was a seriously well behaved kid so I was always the one to apologize for whatever they thought I did that was so horrible   This particular night when the threat entered the air  I saw it as a sign and a fleeting opportunity  I packed my things and was gone the next day  

It s been 4 years and I am now living in a different state with my husband and daughter and our second child is due to be born in about a month "
1942,"Lottery tickets 

I was always curious about lottery tickets but never wanted to indulge in it  One day in a grocery store  I told the universe 

 I am going to buy a lotto ticket now  not the grand bumper ones  just a simple scratch one  for the first time in life  If I win a prize  I ll take it as a sign from you and never buy it again  

I bought a ticket for  3  scratched it and won  500  I smiled and donated  250 of the amount  Enjoyed some good food multiple times with the other  250  Never bought or looked at a lottery ticket again  Will never do "

1945,"I decided to kill myself about the age of 13  Life sucked  and I planned to go home from church that night and off myself if there was no direct intervention 

Out of nowhere my aunt stopped me and said  I feel like you need to come home with me  

And I m still here  

Damn bitch "
1946,"My wife and I had been considering getting a second cat for some time without reaching any conclusion  Then  as I was walking back to the apartment one evening  a young feline popped up out of the drainage beside the sidewalk  Basically  he just looked at me and said  
 Let s cut to the chase  I ll be moving in with you now  You need a cat  I am a very cute  completely adorable kitten  The only problem I see here is that you might not be smart enough to recognize this opportunity  Be your best self right now  dude 

So I looked at him and said   I can t make this decision solo  Let me go get the wife   He just looked at me and nodded his head like  Go on  I ll wait   

Considering that she just decided that today was cat bath day  he may be regretting the decision  but I m completely okay with the way things have gone over the past years "
1947,"My  then  girlfriend was having a really awful week  I felt terrible for her  which made me realize how serious our relationship was because empathy is    not a strong suit of mine  She wanted to take a trip to the Grand Tetons to clear her head  

She wanted to see a moose on this trip  but it was August so relatively unlikely since they tend to move to higher elevations that time of year    I had never seen a moose in the wild 

Before we left  i thought  if we see a moose on this whirlwind 72 hr road trip I will take it as a sign I should marry this girl  

Sure enough  right in the middle of the day  on one of the busiest trails in the park  is a great big bull moose hanging out in the lake  Married 5 years this year "
1948,Sounds really stupid but I was visiting my nanny and she had just spontaneously told me her sexual abuse story  I was shocked and hadn t ever told anyone mine  so on the drive home I jokingly told myself  if there s Y in the next number plate I see on the way home I ll tell my boyfriend my story   probably 9 10 cars had a Y on them  I think it was just a coincidence but at least I got to tell my story and I don t regret it 
1949,I had gotten a job at a retail store and went in for the orientation and to do training  The vibe was kind of off in the store but I ignored it  I got to the back where the computers were but couldn t shake the feeling of being uncomfortable  In my head I said   alright universe  If I m not meant to work here  show me some kind of sign  Make them send me home for the day or something   About an hour later  a huge storm rolled in and shut off the power in the store  The manager came in and said for me to go home since they computers weren t working and I couldn t do my training  A couple months later and I was working at a new job that I absolutely love 
1950,"I had asked the universe for a sign of good and friendly people really existing out in this world  I know  it s kinda stupid but I have struggled with making friends that weren t toxic  and I felt like I just wasn t destined to have great friends 

About two days after I had asked for a sign  I went to my local park to do my daily routine of sitting down  smoking my cigarettes and reading and for some strange reason  a pair of strangers came up to me and introduced themselves 

We ended up talking with each other for what felt like hours and eventually  I had asked them why they came up to me and the guy said  oh  we made a deal to see if we could make any new friends and we did  You re a new friend   After  we all walked and got some cookies and ice cream and chilled again  by the river this time 

They both are now my closest friends  and it all started because I was at the right place  and at the right time for them to come up to me  I strongly believe that it was the universe s doing and am so grateful for it 

Edit  I ve had some questions about how exactly i attracted my friends  I changed my thoughts and my feelings about myself and those around me  i began to become a more happier version of myself and thought of myself as a fun and happy person  i also began to feel the emotions of gratitude and happiness and i would thank the universe for all the good things in me life  Remember  your thoughts and feelings are what create your future and the universe knows nothing more but to attract to you what you attract to it  i hope this helps    

Edit 2  i have told my friends about me asking the universe for new friends that would support and love me regardless  and they said that they had in a way done the same thing  My friends had wanted to make new friends for a while  they had actually made a deal that they would go up and try and make friends  it just happened to be that i was the first person they met and ended up being the person they had hoped to met  I guess  all i can say is just have belief and faith in the universe  don t worry about how you will make the friends you want  just believe that you already have them in your life and they will come  By asking for a sign  your almost daring the universe to show that it is really looking out for you and the universe will always respond  just in a way that you won t expect   

Best of luck to all of you my friends    i wish you nothing but the best "

1952,"At 13 years old  I was being molested by my teacher and was scared as fuck on what he d do to me if I ever tell anyone  I feared going to school everyday and wanted to stay away from him as much as possible  even though I have to or else my grades will drop  So every time he calls for me  I wished the whole universe will save me from this traumatic experience 

One morning  the school chose the few thriving students to attend an awareness program about drugs  sexual abuse  and kidnapping since 7th graders will almost be in high school  I didn t know then what was the program about  but if it gets me away from school  I happily went with my classmates  I listened to all the videos and itade my eyes wide open as I watched a video about a young boy being seduced by an older guy and he molested him  He talked to his parents about it and the predator was arrested months later 

I silently had a mental breakdown after what I saw  And when I went home  I told my family everything 

Years later after therapy and medication from PSTD and depression  I m currently happy with my new school and being on the top of the class again  Needless to say that the teacher was guilty for sexual abuse of many female students after families of that school rallied together to get the man arrest  including mine  Maybe if I haven t went to that program  I wouldn t be here writing about how the world truly cares for the helpless "
1953,My son passed away and I sat at the kitchen table in shock I couldn t really believe he was gone  I asked him to send me a sign so I d know he was still with us  in spirit if not in body  A few minutes later all the lights in the house went out  I didn t believe it was him so I even checked the fuse box  I almost called an electrician but for some reason I couldn t bring myself to do it  It was just the lights  the power points still worked so I could cook and the fridge was on  It stayed that way for two days until I eventually said ok ok I know it s you and they came back on  I was so overwhelmed with grief at the time this seemed like nothing but now I see how crazy it was  I get this might be hard for some people to believe but I really don t care if anyone believes it or not  I just needed to know he was somewhere else besides in the ground because he was only in his 20 s and it just wasn t fair he was gone so young  You should never outlive your children

I like to drive and blast my music when im upset to unwind so i started to drive on the highway and i decided i was finally going to end it  a few minutes before i was going to gear my car off the highway into the lining of trees  i looked in my rear view mirror and saw an ambulance driving behind me  I had never seen an ambulance on the highway that didn t have its signal going and immediately broke down and cried  the ambulance was just cruising behind me  I took that as a sign that the universe did care and that i was significant  So i drove home to my mother and told her i needed help  i was taken to the hospital  put on medication and went to therapy for my underlying issues and depression  

A year and a half later i am off medication  no longer needing therapy  and currently thriving  That ambulance truly saved me that day "

I had a very abusive childhood and don t really speak to my family much so I m very much an independent loner  In a moment of weakness seeking support  I asked the universe and my mother for guidance and that if she really is there watching over me to wake me up at exactly 3 33 AM that night 

She proved she was there for me that night  Woke up randomly at exactly 3 33AM  I found more strength that night and I continue to seek ways of connecting with her "

1959,"During one of the lowest points of my life  I often drove around for hours listening to music  not telling anyone where I was or where I was going 

On one of these drives  I was trying to motivate myself into finally seeking some help or at least talking to people I knew about how deeply depressed I was  and to stop naively driving around without telling anyone where I was going because it was reckless  I was thinking something like   I don t know what to do anymore  God  please give me a sign or something   when the song  Snap Out of It  by the Arctic Monkeys came on  I remember because I was annoyed that it played twice even though I had a playlist on shuffle   I was driving through a side road in the woods at this time  and the road was getting really narrow and muddy  On a tight  and very very muddy turn  I lost control of my car   was sliding off the road straight towards a huge tree

1962,"I d been unhappy in my line of work for some time  I had been reading some self help books  I am not religious  called Conversations with God by Neale Donald Walsch 

It talked about the universe reflecting your thoughts  words and actions directly back at you  I e  Wanting a career change results in a reality of wanting a career change 

There was a message about Being and not Doing  So I wanted to test this with an experiment  as it all sounded a bit mumbo jumbo  So I volunteered in a special needs youth club   so I could Be and give what I wanted the universe to reflect back at me 

This led to a job as a support worker for special needs in a college  which led to completing a Distance learning Degree  which led to teacher training  which led to being a graduate lecturer  which led to deputy management of a whole faculty and ultimately a career helping 100s of people each year 

I have continued to practice this Creating your own reality philosophy of Being through thoughts  speech and actions  The number of times it works cannot be just luck  Believing in luck is just as far fetched if you really think about it

1963,Coming out for the very first time  I was really  unnecessarily  nervous  it was to a good friend of mine and I saw him walking around with rainbow socks  then I knew I would be fine  so after 5 minutes of akward stumbling I said that I m bi and he just replied with a smooth  oh me too lol 
1964,"When I was a teenager I had bad problems with depression and anxiety that led to very self destructive behavior  There were many times I imagined killing myself and one night I was set on doing it  Came home drunk and sad and started cutting myself  which was one of my methods for dealing with my emotions  

I sat in my bed crying  trying to find the courage to cut deeper and end it  Then my dog Snoopy hopped up on the bed and put his head on my lap  Thanks to him doing that I realized that I just couldn t do that to him or to my parents and friends  He saved my life that night  

The next day I decided to open up to my parents and ask them to help me find some help  which was a huge step forward  Starting seeing a therapist and she really helped me work through a lot of things  Still struggle a bit sometimes  but I m able to manage thanks to the help I received and I credit that little loveable mutt for me being around today "
1965,Years ago I had lost my job  I was doing a lot of temp and part time gigs  but there would be dry spells where I couldn t find anything  I liked to go on long walks  just around the city or down by the lake  maybe through a park  Just be by myself thinking about life and what to do next  I d talk with myself  have conversations with the universe  I d ask   Do I really have a shot at pulling my life together  Everything is so messed up  Will I find some meaning  Some direction  Or am I cursed to just wander lost till I m eventually hit by a car or struck by lightning or caught in a fire  If that s my fate why not get it over with  either that or give me some hope to believe in   Well a few weeks later I got my answer  I was hit by a car 
1966,"One day  I was at my schools robotics team building session after school  There was this freshman  who I didn t know prior to this event  and who I will call X from here on   is sitting on the stairs talking with someone on the phone  I only walked by  but I could tell that X was getting very emotional and frustrated with the person on the phone  to the point tears were coming down their face  I continue on my way to go and grab my computer  which was in a room down the hall from the stairs  and when I returned X was just sitting there  I asked X if they were okay and if they needed someone to talk to  X said no  and went away to the workshop area where the robot was  Later  one of the teachers who runs the program  needed a couple of people to brainstorm and design some of the different functions of the robot  X  1 or 2 friends of my friends  and I volunteer  We go to this room  and we all start talking  all of us except for X  My friends go out of the room to grab some supplies to start modeling our designs  and in their absences I once again ask X if they are okay  After a couple of seconds  X says no  and they start talking about how their stepfather is abusive  and how their mom doesn t do anything to stop it  Once they were done talking  and after us just talking about life  I give X my SnapChat so that if they ever need to talk to someone without judgement  they could confide in me  I usually never do this  and at the time I found it was weird that I was doing so  After my friends return and we do a bit of designing  I had to leave and go to a soccer practice  as I have soccer practice and robotics meetings on the same night

After a mostly boring practice  I returned home and grabbed my phone and turned it on to see that I had just received a message from X  I open the message and it says   I m committing suicide   At this point I freak out  and show my parents  I had basically just met X and they were telling me this  My parents called 911  as I start messaging X trying to figure out where they were  and if they were with anyone  After getting the police and ambulance to their house  X was taken to the hospital and was being treated  the dispatcher called us back to tell us all of this   The next day  I went to school and I found out that X had tried to overdose on prescription medications  X had already taken the drugs when EMS arrived  

This whole series of events made me think of how the universe helped me save a life  I didn t know X   I hadn t had a conversation with them before  I never asked to be apart of this  but I was  

I know this didn t answer correctly  but it was a sign the universe gave  Also I am sorry for any misuse of grammar or weird wording anywhere  it is hard to recount all of the details from that night  and It s been hard for me to write down everything that happened  

TL DR Universe set me up to save a person from committing suicide 

Edit  Besides a couple of lung issues that are treatable  X is doing good  We talk just about every day now  and become good friends  

Also  thank you to every one who took the time to read  and to any one who it may effect  if you are ever in need of help  no matter how serious  there will always be someone for you to talk to  you don t need to fight your battles alone "

1968,"I was at a point in my life where I was trying to figure out my relationship with God  spiritual but not entirely religious  so I went on a weekend church retreat with a friend  

It was in the mountains during the beginning of summer so we were all sleeping outside looking up at the stars  It was  prayer hour  in the middle of the night so we were quiet but there was worship music playing  very peaceful  

I suddenly got emotional and silently prayed to myself asking if my cousin was safe  up there   he passed away when we were both very young  and I immediately saw my first shooting star  It made me really emotional and every time I see a shooting star I take it as a sign of him saying  hey I m doing good  you re doing good "
1969,I was feeling depressed and lonely after a rough break up on top of problems at home  I just asked the universe if there was anyone out there who could actually love a messed up person like me  A few days later  I met my now fiancé because he wanted to know what I was sketching  We now live together and are still as dorky as the day we met 
1970,Bad  My mother died when I was very young  She was amazing and loved all animals  She dreamed and hoped to have a farm where all animals could come and live out their lives  the only cost to them would be allowing a pet or a scratch from her   Brain cancer had its own ideas  Saddled with the bills after she died  my dad and I couldn t afford to buy her ashes from the funeral home  Her side of the family bought them and scattered them in a nearby park with a pond  I found out months later  They didn t even bother to call me  I went there and begged God for a sign  Immediately after I looked down and saw a duck  obviously dead and half submerged in the frozen water  The duck s feathers were beautiful  but it was a dead as can be  its eyes white and glazed  The feeling I got was that death is final  and there s no real coming to terms with it  That was thirty seven years ago and I ve never asked for a sign since 
1971,I asked the universe for a sign for whether or not I should continue with my graduate studies as planned  or switch to something easier  That evening I went for a walk with my friend through the local cemetery  and while off the trail  we walked past a gravestone with my professor s actual full name on it  I was so shook that I didn t even say anything to my friend at the time  I stayed with my plans  and am now on schedule to graduate this summer

1974,"About a year ago I was without a steady job and tackling work as a background actor  finding work can be inconsistent and as a non union the pay isn t top tier   It was fine as acting is really the career I want to be in  but what wasn t fine was the instability  I only had so much money for my bills and expenditures  constantly on the brink of broke  had credit card debt  all that financial misery  

Before that I was working in manufacturing warehouses  which was steady and simple  However  it was absolutely miserable work to me  Tedious handiwork  constant standing   lifting of heavy things  being scrutinized every day even when doing above and beyond  and absolutely no free time  I d left that work behind when I chose to finally take acting  but the financial hardship was starting to drive me back to the stability of full time jobs grudgingly  

I had one job lined up as a warehouse employee again and was finishing up a call with a representative to start the onboarding process  All that time while i was on the phone I was just thinking about the monotony of this line of work  and the fact that if I took the job I d turn my back on what I really wanted to do  and could possibly be stuck in a dead end job  It got me thinking to myself about the good times I d had working on different sets  going to far out areas I d never been to  and the happiness I got from jobs I actually enjoyed  When I came out of it  I thought to myself   You know what  I ll take the job if I have to  but if I get a call for even just one background job  I m just gonna stick out the waiting    This was during the end of the dry season of filming 

Not even 10 minutes later I got a call for not one but multi day jobs  Enough to not only keep me stable but get me above the debts I was getting in 

So I declined the warehouse job  stuck with acting  worked at it with a more determined mindset  and by the end of the year I was able to join a union with no more debt and more stability than where I was at the year before

TL DR   Starving artist  debates returning to warehouse job  sticks with acting and gets good with it"
1975,"This is cross posted from another sub   


So  when succulents became the craze  I bought a few  I panicked because they weren t happy and overwatered all of them  The pots I had didn t have proper drainage either  The poor things all drowned  Around the same time  changes were made at work  nursing home  that made it very hard to properly care for everyone  One of the people affected was Flash Gordon  not his real name  he was dying  and he was my friend  He made me promise not to quit until after he died as I was the only one patient enough with his grumpy ass  When he passed I couldn t stop crying at work  Someone grabbed this little guy from his room and began overwatering it at the nurses station  I then decided that since I couldn t save Flash  I d save the succulent  

Almost a year passes  I ve stayed and kept all my promises  but I m miserable  Administration doesn t do shit  and people are suffering  I m no longer effective because my mental health is severely suffering  I didn t want to abandon them  and I was ready to set myself ablaze to keep em warm  Finally  I asked the universe for a sign that I should leave  The next morning I wake up and this little guy had a huge stalk I apparently hadn t noticed  There were blossoms all throughout  A tear ran down my cheek  I thanked Flash  and put in my two weeks  


Best decision I ever made  I have a wonderful job  a baby on the way  and peace "

1977,"I was 15 when I moved out of my moms house  I was making a real effort to reconnect with friends after depression suicidal tendencies had driven me away from them  and was making real strides after leaving my abusive home  Talking to people  being near people at all  was a real struggle  

One morning just before class started a friend of mine walked past and even tho I was usually super paranoid about being late to class I stopped him and talked to him for a bit  Turns out he had just that morning broken up with his girlfriend  who none of us knew was very cruel and manipulative  He had been with her for years and it took a lot for him to do that  I gave him a hug  which was crazy cause I usually hated being touched  and told him he would find the right person  that he deserved better 

Well  somehow  it turns out he thinks I m the right person  We ve been together almost 10 years now and I can t imagine being without him  Not sure I believe in signs or whatever  but that day I did something way out of character and its paid off ever since"

Huge Borderlands fan   Wanted Borderlands 3 so bad but had to wait for it to go to Steam  still expensive as hell

1979,"In 2016  I was planning a move to L A  at the end of my lease at a townhouse in Ohio  The lease was set to end on Aug  31 

As I began networking with people in Cali  I started to get very weird vibes about moving  Some were suggesting I shouldn t at all due to the high costs  while others were Encouraging it but maybe didn t have judgment I trusted  Other things were contributing  but I was feeling very strange about it   hard to explain  It just didn t quite feel right 

During my last week at the rental  I asked the universe to send a definite sign on whether or not I should go 

On Aug 27  I completely cleared out my car so I could begin moving boxes to my parents house who lived about 40 miles north  That night around 2 am  I was packing in the living room  when suddenly I heard my car start up outside  it had a very distinctive start up sound  so I knew it was mine   I ran to the front door and opened it just in time to see my car finish backing out and driving away  The car was found a few days later totaled in the city  

It was never clear how the thief started the vehicle  since I still had the keys and no wiring had been messed with  it was surmised by police that he d had a skeleton key for that make and model  perhaps it was the teenage son of an auto dealer or something   Anyway  I got a full insurance payout on the vehicle 

Other damage to my things were minimal  as the car had been completely cleared out for moving  While the event itself was very frustrating and even a little traumatic  to me  that felt clear as day to be a sign that I wasn t supposed to go to L A  I have regrets in my life  but not moving out there has never been one of them "
1980,"I asked the universe for a sign of love or someone to love  

I was riding my bike the first sunny day of last month  I loved bike rides feeling the wind in my hair and honestly feeling like I m on top of the world  

love for me has always been taboo and honestly was starting to not believe it  the sun hit my face just right and closed my eyes and made the wish for a sign of actual love   

best mistake of my life was closing my eyes while riding my bike 

as I opened my eyes very shortly after  I ran into this very pretty girl riding her bike  we both flew off and hit the grass as soon as it happened  we both looked at each other and just stared  good 5s passed before she grimaced  

her ankle looked broke but wasn t sure  I ended up calling the ambulance and ended up talking with her waiting for the ambulance finding out we had a lot in common and me bewildered how she was so strong  

ambulance came and she gave me her number as well as her father s  I called up her dad and he came and picked me up with the bikes  I was dropped off home and I hit her up asking for the verdict on her ankle  it was dislocated with possible ligament issues that she has to wear a boot for awhile  

well  cutting to the chase we ended up dating after it all and honestly the happiest and seemingly healthiest relationship I ve ever been in

1981,"I was on a mission trip in Central America when I was a teenager with my dad  He didn t know but I was questioning my faith  I prayed the hardest I had ever prayed in my life  I knew the bible talks about God not giving signs  but I was really torn up and asked for one anyway  

The country I was in  you couldn t drink the water  But one night I wasn t thinking and brushed my teeth with tap water  

The next day  we went into a cave where they said there had been human sacrifices  My dad decided on a kind of impromptu exorcism to get rid of the evil spirits or demons or whatever  So we re all standing in a circle holding hands  and the first of my Montezuma s Revenge farts slips out    and it was RANK  Deadly  but silent   nobody knew it was me  

My dad smells it  remember we re in a cave   the fart has nowhere to escape to  we have to just marinate in it  and gets SUPER excited   The bible says an exorcised spirit will leave behind the smell of brimstone  We really accomplished something here today   

And that was my sign  I had suspected for a while that my dad was semi crazy and willing to interpret anything to reinforce his religious beliefs  and he confirmed it for me then  That was 15 years ago  I ve been an atheist ever since "

I ve always had a deep deep love for Frida Kahlo   it s my DREAM to see a full exhibition of hers   and love one of her quotes in particular   podemos aguantar mucho más de lo que pensamos que podemos   we can endure much more than what we think we can  and used this quote to remind myself everything will be okay   

Anyway  so here I was  sad and alone in a big city looking for any reason not to get on a plane and head straight home and give it all up  One day I m thinking of this Frida quote and wander into an art museum that I hadn t visited before to take my mind off how low I was feeling  I walk inside and what do I see right in the middle of the art gallery wall 

A real life Frida Kahlo painting

I used to be addicted to ice tea when I was a teenager  I d buy soluble ice tea and drink about 6 liters  1 6 gallons  of it every day  I knew it wasn t doing any good to my teeth and kidneys  but I couldn t help it  So  one night I was walking home through a silent  deserted downtown  I was thinking about finally getting healthy drinking habits and I asked myself  Should I stop drinking ice tea    I looked up and on the building in front of me there was a single big neon sign spelling  Siva   but only the first two letters were lit  spelling  yes  in Italian

I never got to see my husband with my crazy hours while making minimum wage  The very few friends I had were toxic  new manager was horrendous  and I was overall going through a pit of depression 

My husband and I finally had a free day and decided to take stroll through the park  As I was grabbing my bag  I asked the universe for good news  specifically requesting to make a genuine friend

2002,"My buddy got out of jail and I let him stay with me for a bit  but told him he needed to find a new place in a couple weeks   He was recently sober so I was trying to help him out   His recent sobriety caused a bunch of mental issues for him to come up to the point that it made me very uncomfortable although it was pretty innocent and he wasn t dangerous to me or anyone   Just some temporary delusions and schizophrenia or something 

For example  I am a software engineer and he recently realized he was gay and he thought I had somehow programmed his brain to be gay for me   Anyways   I kicked him out when the two weeks were up   Fastforward a couple of days and I get back home and there he is mowing my lawn   Instead of being understanding I exploded on him and told him to fuck off and leave me alone   He left 

Fast forward a week   I got a new job that he had no idea I had and it was about an hour drive from my house so well out of the way   I pull up to the gas station near my work and I see him sitting in a car with someone  high out of his mind   Too high to notice me even standing right in front of the car 

I feel like it was the universes way of telling me to be kind because In a way I caused him to relapse when I exploded on him   He and I are still best friends to this day   He still struggles with drugs but his brain isn t quite so crazy anymore   Haven t heard from him for a couple weeks and I really hope he is doing alright   


For the record this happened a couple years ago and he and I have basically been friends since high school so 20  years   We ve known each other long enough that his his siblings introduce me as their brother and his mom and dad introduce me as their son to people   It was just a weird time for him that made me highly uncomfortable and I feel like it was just trying to show me why its important to be understanding "

She went to sleep  not taking the pills and had a dream that a man came into her room and knocked the pills off of the side  She woke up and the pills were all over the floor  so she must have acted out her dream

I started walking and i saw a 5euro bill on the ground  My heart was racing  When i went to pick it up  i noticed it was just trash

They both shared a love of gardening  Since that day  whenever she is out doing her gardening  there s always a robin somewhere nearby   no matter the time of year  I know this because she told me the story when I was younger and I always used to look out for Pops in the garden

Basically  from time to time I get really sad and depressed about who I am and if my friends don t see me only as a nuisance and if what I am doing is right  You know  standard questions 

So one day when this sadness came and I couldn t sleep  I was thinking and I said out loud  I really wish I can become a good person so my friends can rely on me and have a good time with me   After that I fell asleep pretty soon 

After like 3 days I was hanging out with a bunch of my friends and this one girl started talking about how she was having a chat with her parents about me and how they all think I am a really good person and that all the good in me is so easy to see to anyone

2021,"My younger sister has been ill for a long time  Around January 2019  I was sick with worry that the end was near  

At this time  I was at a conference of about 40 000 people for a  few days  I was getting overwhelmed as I was around so many people  so I broke away from my friends  

I went outside to get some air and a face full of snow  All I could think about was my sister  I asked the universe  God  somebody  anybody  for a sign that my sister would live and be ok  I asked for an orange rose  If I got to see an orange rose before the conference ended  I would know she would be ok 

Standing outside a packed hotel on a busy city street in winter  my expectations were low  So I put my name tag back on and went inside  I went to the main room that was packed with 40k people to try to go back to where I left my friends  

While shoving through people  out of the corner of my eye  I saw the word  Rose   My eyes snapped to the source of the stray word  and I saw a girl with bright orange hair and a name tag that read   Rose  

The orange rose  

  

Just in case you re wondering  my little sister is doing much much better  She s past the worst of it  and although she s got a bit of recovery to go  she s thriving  vibrant  and alive  A beautiful rose that bloomed again even in the bleakest winter "

2023,"Had a deep fear of commitment and major abandonment issues  Started having feelings for my best friend of many years  got physical  but I was too afraid too pursue something more 
I live in London and he lives in Athens 

One day he calls me saying he got a letter that he has to be presented for his army training  in Greece army training is 9 months  and is mandatory for all men  but if you are in university you can postpone it  He had forgotten to send his university s proof of studying  It was extremely unlikely he could do something about it because it was Friday amd he had to be presented in a Greek island  on Monday    
I freaked out that I will lose him forever but I was too afraid to do anything 
Before I went to sleep I said that if he manages to postpone it  I will tell him how I feel and try to put my fears aside  Not just with him  but in my life in general 

Next morning he calls me to tell me he did it  I blurted out that I was in love with him  He booked tickets the same day to come to London  We just had our 2 year anniversary and I ve been happier than ever  and feel much better in most aspects of my life  with his help support 


I dont know if it was exactly a sign  but it sure felt like it "
2024,"Not so much clear as day  but when the Boston marathon bombing happened I recall a decision about 15 minutes prior as to whether or not to go watch the marathon from the finish line or go home  just down the street from the BPL    

As I was considering the decision I got a headache and decided to go home  Within 30 seconds of leaving the elevator and walking into my house the first bomb detonated "
2025,"This might be a long slog but please stick with it  I think it s a great story and it truly changed my life

I struggle with my mental health and a couple of years ago when I first discovered I had issues had a proper breakdown  Although I had been depressed for a long time  I was starting to become suicidal  I didn t feel attached to life anymore or anyone involved in it  I was convinced all my feelings where a product of society though  spoiler alert they weren t  and that if I removed myself from the 9 5 and lived  freely  I would be a lot more at peace  So  I took a sabbatical and decided to travel Australia for a year  largely because I hadn t done any long term travelling before and there would be no language barrier 

I started off in Melbourne loved the city but was still felt no better  I had a date with a Japanese girl during my time there  it didn t go very well and I was disappointed  While sitting waiting for a tram another Japanese girl sat beside me  she picked up a little doll from the floor gave it to me and said she hadn t seen one from a while it was from her home city  I took the doll and tried to make conversation  assuming she wanted to talk as she started a conversation  She didn t really talk back though which I found unusual so I left her too it 

Fast forward 2 months I ve attached the doll to my bag as I like little novelty things like that and am now working on an apple farm In Tasmania  I m still depressed but starting to need the money  Meet my first friend there funnily enough a boy from Japan who recognises the doll and says it s a famous thing and comes from the town across from his  I spend one day down by the beach  bump into a woman and get talking  She tells me that if I ever find myself in Hobart to contact her as often  they need backpackers to help out the community centre she works in  Fast forward a couple of weeks and the apple farm has ran out of apples and I need money  Still depressed I provide the universe with an ultimatum  A couple of the girls in the hostel mentioned how they hitchhiked up from Hobart  I decided if the Universe and through extension people care about me it will also look out for me by helping me get down to Hobart through hitchhiking  where I would hopefully find some bar work  

I did hitchhike down it took a couple of hours before someone picked me up  but once they did they came in quick succession and I made it down on time to book in at my next hostel  To you that might seem like nothing but for me at that time and with the very low self esteem I had to have people accept me in that way  despite me being a total stranger who through no fault of my own may not look the friendliest was overwhelming  It took 3 people to get down and I had 3 great conversations  especially with the last  She was a woman who started working in mental health after her son had taken his own life  after hearing this I felt comfortable explaining my story and why I was here  And in a way she seemed genuinely happy for me  almost as through her son she could see other young men addressing their issues and trying to make it work  She even offered to let me stay for the night but I declined 

Turns out I arrived in Winter and no one was needing any bar staff  So  I contacted the Woman at the beach who said she doesn t need any work done but her friend might  I contacted her friend who said not long term but a backpacker had cancelled just before my message so she had a days work available  I went and worked in her garden for the day and we got on great she even invited me back on the Sunday  she was throwing a party and I handed out the snacks  I was in a remote area and my accent was a nice novelty for the guests 

No work was forthcoming still so I decided to gamble it all and try one last part of the country  worst case I d see more of it before I had to leave  I contacted her asking if it was possible if I could spend one night there in order to save money before moving on  She instead asked if I would like to move in with her for a couple of months and she would pay me to work on her own little farm  I of course accepted  I really wasn t much use if I m honest  I was a city boy from a single parent home with no diy skills  And yet despite this she taught me how to do all the work she needed done and then paid me for it  Coming from my background as well healthy eating and cooking was never taught  and she taught and helped me to make far healthier meals again out of her own pocket  and we would eat together every night  All this while I wasn t even paying rent  I often wondered why she was being so nice  she was a deeply spiritual person and believed in a Japanese religion I d never heard of  She believed in reincarnation and karma and she told me at one point she believed maybe we met through a karmic debt she had to me in a past life  Which I wasn t really on board with until little coincidences kept popping up for example  Our ancestors where from the same part of Ireland  our dogs both had the same very unusual name  And then less strange things like her having the same name as my own auntie and a little boy that came to visit her was the spitting image and shared the same name as my little brother back home  Later on  though I discovered her own partner had taking his own life due to depression and we shared the same name  that s when I started to think maybe there was something too it 

As well as teaching me about diy and cooking she was also a great counsellor of sorts and helped me see a lot of things from a different angle  A lot of the issues I had which lead to poor mental health I was able to work through with her advice  I wasn t completely cured but it did a wonder of good and I was able to call her for advice throughout my travels later on when I left the farm 

The thing that really sealed it for me though that the universe had my back  and this lady was introduced to me deliberately though came in my final week there  At the weekends she would drop me of in the City centre and I would do odd jobs for extra money  One day she noticed the little doll on my bag and asked about it  I told her the story and she took a photo to have her friend who speaks Japanese translate what its top said  And it turned out the doll was from the city her spiritual headquarters was based and a city she had visited many times and a place she had even booked up to go back to later this year  

I know there might be nothing in it but a string of little coincidences but like I said I enjoy little novelties like that  and I truly felt like the Universe was looking out for me 

TLDR  I asked the universe to have my back and it did time and time again "
2026,"I was 12 and suicidal  I couldn t see myself living another month 

My most suicidal months were March and April 2018  I had lost all hope and for me it wasn t a question of how  but when  My first attempt was in March  My brother s birthday was on April 5 and after my first attempt failed I told myself I was gonna wait until 2 weeks after his birthday  because I didn t want the anniversary of my death to be so close to a day he should enjoy 

My next and worst attempt was on April 15  10 days after his birthday  It was so painful that it actually scared the shit out of me and that s why I didn t attempt to OD again  The thing is that I can remember how much of a hell living one more day was  If his birthday wasn t in April then I might have been dead right now 

Idk if it was a sign or not  but it saved my life  That s what matters "
2027,Damn  I just googled that bird and yeah that s 100  a sign lol
2028,This is gonna sound messed up but i thought you were going to say you parked your car and went home and when you got back you found your car covered in more bird poop then ever before and that was your sign from the universe
2029,100  a sign  But also  100  a lost pet  My cousin lives in Brooklyn and posts pictures of exotic birds she finds in her neighborhood all of the time  looking for their owners  as they rarely are able to survive outside on their own

2032,I don t believe in anything like that either but when I lost my Dad a couple of years ago I caught myself asking the same things   Any kind of sign   I think it s part of coping with the grief   I don t have an awesome story but I understand   And I m sorry for your loss   Life can be tough sometimes 
2033,I lost my father rather tragically a little over a year ago  On his death bed I told him I know he has to go to heaven but if it were possible for him to stick around for a little while I wouldn t hate it  I m not even religious or believe in any of that stuff but at the time it made sense  Boy did he show himself too  When my family met with a lawyer friend of his  to go over his estate a lightbulb burnt out in the room which was perfectly timed  I started a side job working in carpentry after he passed and he would have absolutely loved that  He taught me all that stuff growing up and the first project I worked on was this really beautiful deck  I swear I saw him out of the corner of my eye at the site one day  Also  I ended up inheriting his car and one day I was cleaning it out and found a quarter under the seat  I always look to see if it s my birth year and before I looked I said to myself  if this quarter is my birth year it s a sign   Sure enough it was my birth year  Now that quarter lives in the cup holder forever  I dk if any of these signs are real or whatever but they sure are comforting  Losing people is tough  Nice to know we have some stuff to help us get through 
2034,"Similar story  stuck in a horrific job  eating myself to death at McDonald s  I was having a particularly shitty day and my boss had screamed at me and the other technicians over something that she  the boss  had fucked up

2044,"Similar story happened to my father  My grandmothers house used to have quite a few moths  We never had moths in our house  When she passed my father started drinking a lot which is what ended up killing my grandmother  It destroyed her liver and she was going to AA but it was too late  I tried talking to my dad about it but he was to depressed to listen  One night I hear him crying asking for help from God  I don t believe in God but the next day I see my dad grabbing some whisky and as he s about to drink there s suddenly moths around him  He believed it was sign from my grandmother and he put the glass down  He stopped drinking because of it  After that the moths disappeared  

A few years later his father is diagnosed with prostate cancer  He lost the battle to cancer  After the funeral service we came home and again there s moths around my father  Now whenever he sees moths he feels comfort because he sees it as a sign from my grandmother "
2045,"This is something that happens in my family  

My Oma  my mother s mom  was the most wonderful lady you could imagine  And what was amazing was how wonderful she was coming from a childhood surviving WWII in the rural german countryside  This included not dying from starvation by foraging the forests for edible tubers  helping hide her family under the floorboards of their house to avoid both german and russian death and rape gangs  watching her father be killed in front of her by a nazi doctor forcing a poisonous injection into him  on Christmas eve   Her father was a doctor who didn t support the nazi party and happened to have a heart murmur  The doctor used a checkup as an opportunity to murder my great grandfather  I think my Oma was 10 at the time  

She saw and lived through horror and food insecurity that most people can t comprehend  Yet  still  she managed to come out the other side without that horror darkening her outlook and capacity for love  Instead I think it made her even more focused on bringing light and hope into her life and her family s lives 

My Oma had this thing for picking up pennies  Didn t matter what side it was on  all pennies were lucky  She d say the same thing whenever she d pick up a penny   finding a penny is always lucky  someone s looking out for you because it s one penny that you didn t have before   

My Oma was diagnosed with breast cancer when back in the 90s when cancer therapies were definitely not as good as they are now  She went through a remission before the cancer came back and she sadly died  It was devestating on everyone in the family  She was such a loving family matriarch   and was such an inspiration of having a huge capacity for hope and love in the face of sadness   darkness 

From then on  an interesting thing happens to people in the family     Whenever someone is going through a very tough time in their life  they start to find pennies everywhere  Like a noticeable amount  If you think about it  you could go weeks without finding a penny on the ground  But when any of us would be consumed with sadness hopelessness suicidal thoughts like  this is too much I don t think I can go on   we d start finding pennies on the ground every day  Even multiple pennies a day  And even more interesting  the pennies would most often be really shiny  And then when someone starts to feel better and regain confidence hope strength    the instance of finding pennies would start to decrease and go away  

This has happened to everyone in our immediate family  even multiple times for people  I m not religious at all  but this really defies explanation   and now I just go with it you know  Like myself and the family see this penny phenomena as a sign from Oma that things will get better  And for every penny we find    it s a physical reminder that she s there with us    supporting us and imbibing us with her own perseverance  hope  and love 

And what s cute is that when the pennies start coming in  we keep a little pile of them   and people in the family have these little mason jars of  Oma pennies  to represent tough times in their lives that they got through  It s quite literally a physical sign  just like your feather  from the universe loved one to just let you know that  everything is going to be okay  "

On Saturday morning  I get a picture from my mum of an adorable but terrified six week old little black kitten   Cute  I want   I messaged her half joking  The kitten had been dumped in the woods and my parents found her when they were walking the dog  They then took her to the rescue shelter  who warned that if she wasn t adopted that day she d die  rescues in my parents  country are not in a good state  

Cue a frenzied amount of phone calls on a Saturday afternoon we were two weeks out from a vacation we couldn t cancel  including having the vet give her shots so she could go in the cattery we had booked for our eldest  and the next day we drove 2 5 hours to another country to pick her up

2102,"First off  I truly believe in signs  

Second  whether it was or wasn t a sign  I m glad you told him"
2103,I told my wife several years ago and I 100  regret it 
2104,Was there really anything off about the company in the end  though 
2105,Thor s looking out for you my man
2106,That s fair enough  but your uncomfortable feeling could have been from the storm itself
2107,"I know someone else get lucky this way too  

It s a beautiful post you ve written  I m still waiting for friends after I lost a few due to them moving"
2108,Can you ask the universe to have me meet my future girlfriend 
2109,Most humble thing I ve ever read  I m just gonna go waterboard myself to tone it down a hair 
2110,The wrong man in the right place can make all the difference in the world
2111,"Now imagine if those two  instead of being proactive  had been waiting for a sign too   

I am saying this more to myself than anyone reading  just do something aboit things that bother you"
2112,I m surrounded by fake people  cant help but think that s mostly my fault  Gonna petition the universe for a sign or a little bit of help   
2113,"Every time I start the lawnmower it starts to rain

2114,This made me lol  love picturing that dance back into the house 😂😂
2115,You re incredibly brave to have spoken up about what was happening  
2116,"These programs are so so important and are often run by volunteer based organisations  Please support these organisations that are helping to educate kids on something that could save their lives  

The healthy relationships education program for students that my volunteer group ran was relying almost exclusively on donations and volunteers   with just one paid staff member who supervised the program  

I wish I had had a program like this  it could have prevented years of sexual abuse in my life  I m so glad you found the courage to speak up 

Your last line resonated with me because that s very similar to what I say about the sexual assault support centre that provided me with trauma and group counselling as an adult  They saved my life and I believe there is goodness and love in this world "
2117,Hope he rots in jail
2118,So glad you spoke up and he was arrested  I m so sorry that happened to you  but happy you re happy and thriving now 
2119,"My sister lost her husband at the age of 32 to cancer  I slept at her house the night he passed away  I slept with my two year old niece and my sister slept with her four year old son  Shortly after my niece  feel asleep  she started swatting at her face and giggling in her sleep saying  no more kisses daddy   

Talking to my sister the next morning  she told me that shortly after her son fell asleep  he randomly stood up in his bed and cried out  I love you too daddy  then went back to sleep  

Just typing this now  my phone randomly autocorrected when I was typing the word  niece  into  Bruce     my deceased brother in law s name  I always feel like he s watching over us "
2120,"My late fiancé s mother in law did the same thing    except instead of lights going off  her favourite bird in his favourite colour appeared on her feeder  A certain type she hadn t seen on her property in years  He comes back whenever she s having a really bad day or when she speaks to me  That s not coincidence  Neither were the lights  They re here  3

Edit  fiancés mother  She was going to be my mother in law    not his lol"
2121,I m so sorry for your loss  Thank you for sharing that beautiful story  They never really leave us 
2122,"Something eerily similar happened to me  My boyfriend passed away in a car crash  I moved cities shortly after  and was having a particularly bad night where I just felt so broken as he was the only support I had at the time  I was crying and told him that I didn t know where he was or if he was even listening  and expressed how badly I needed to know 
Not even five minutes later  all of the Christmas lights that I had strung up around my room started blinking  A sense of comfort flooded me  and they kept blinking until I had calmed down and stopped crying  This had never happened before  and never happened again in that house  All of the other lights in the room stayed on throughout this "
2123,My grandfather was always complaining about people leaving the back floodlight on  The night he had died we were all inside his house and someone had left the floodlight on out the back  It started flicking on and off  then stopped  It never happened again  but is generally accepted in our family as a sign from him 
2124,Im so sorry for your loss 
2125,Mine died at 22 last year  I am so sorry for your loss  I feel like I will never get over it  ever  it really is the worst  X
2126,I was feeling suicidal  too  I was in such a bad place  I decided to end it all one night  Got in a cab and asked the driver to take me to a bridge   There are a lot of big bridges in Seoul   He saw me crying in the backseat and asked me why I wanted to go to the bridge  I told him that I wanted to jump off of it and then he pulled the car over to the side of the road and then asked if he could pray for me  I started to sob as he prayed  At the end  he took me home free of charge  Before I got off  he asked for my number so that he could check up on me  This was five years ago and he still sends me prayers to this day 
2127,"Its kind of crazy how depression can just sneak up on you like that  One day its manageable and then it seems like it spirals out of nowhere 

I had a wake up call moment as well  3am  drunk as shit  and I had contemplated killing myself for a while at that point  I got my gun out of the closet  put it in my mouth  and dry pulled the trigger just to see what it would felt like 

Once I did that  an insane amount of relief washed over me  I knew this wasn t normal and called my primary the next day  I still think about horrible thoughts every day  but they re getting easier and easier to ignore "
2128,Thanks for sharing your wonderful story  I find it truly inspiring and it even put a smile on my face  at the end  Not to say that I make light of the pain you went through  but the way you tell it makes me feel genuinely happy for the outcome  and I thank this ambulance for unwittingly saving your life  friend  Keep it up  you re awesome    
2129,"I had a similar moment  I was on a usually empty  remote road ready to drive into a tree 

I drop gear and start speeding down the road ready to  miss  a corner when headlights appear in front of me  I suddenly slow the fuck down and pull over  I wasn t willing to hurt someone else to hurt myself 

I never felt like I could tell anyone in my life about my shit though so I have always kept it internal "
2130,Can testify  that bond is strong and remember that you actually share real cells from your mother  She is alive within you  Listen to that small voice telling you to take good care of you 
2131,Asking for support is not weakness  it is the reverse 
2132,Same  I m sitting outside with tears in my eyes asking for some guidance and come across this  Not a coincidence I would say 
2133,Nature abides  And dads do too 
2134,"That s an intense experience  I m glad you made it out okay  

I had a music one too  I d just heard for the fifth time in two weeks that I didn t get a job I d applied to  I was desperate and frustrated and asked the universe for a sign  Turned on my car and Adam Lambert s song  Whattaya want from me  was playing  Specifically it was at this part 

 Just don t give up
I m workin  it out
Please don t give in
I won t let you down

A week later I got a call offering me a job  I ve been at that job for ten years now "
2135,I have no idea if this is even true but girl this is the funniest shit I ve read all week  You are a hell of a writer 
2136,"Love this  3 Imagine the break up line   

 EX  I m breaking up with you  You ve done some messed up stuff to me  but really I just can t live with the constant threat of getting smacked by cosmic rogue fish  "
2137,"Im really sorry about this OP but   

Holy mackerel thats a good story"
2138,I feel so bad for laughing as hard as i just did  If thats not a sign  then idk what is 
2139,I guess you could say you dodged a bullet there  Glad you sister and the rain kept you home 
2140,OMG
2141,Me too 
2142,My dad did that to me lmao  always knew coming out would be totally fine but when I finally did he was just like  cool  me too   Typical him lol
2143,Dogs are so great at reading us   Glad you are doing better 
2144,Howre you doing now 
2145,Probably the least terrible of the three dispel options  hope you had a hasty recovery 
2146,Well at least now you know you don t need to wander anymore   fingers crossed 
2147,please please tell me that X is ok
2148,"Wow  

Were you friends with X after that  Or do you know what happened to him "
2149,"Maybe it is related to the topic 
Maybe X woke up that morning and asked the universe if he had to end his life that day  Then he met you and you saved him that  You were the sign from the universe "
2150,I guess you just gotta keep on waiting  Might take a whole lifetime 
2151,"Well  imagine how many people might have the same doubt as you right now  Imagine how many might see this and realize they re not alone in how they feel  Furthermore  imagine how many other instances like that will probably happen in your life  Imagine how many other people s lives you could potentially improve in some small way over the course of your own 

Now  I know I m not the universe  but does that count as a response "
2152,I am glad you are here❤️
2153,This post perhaps 
2154,Bread sticks
2155,what were you sketching 
2156,maybe it was a sign to tell you that death   despite being final for us on this side   can also be beautiful on the other side of it and now your mom is out there somewhere venturing the afterlife with all the animals she loved so much  Who knows  maybe the beautiful duck you saw is there with her too  I am sorry for your loss and that you didnt have the possibility to participate in her ashes being scattered  but still she will hold a special place in your heart forever 
2157,Your mom wanted you to be strong  And she knew what would work for you 
2158,That s unspeakable that they d charge for ashes  I don t have words for that    but it makes me really angry  I m so sorry for your loss 
2159,Great story though 
2160,Was the next song Because I Got High by Afroman 
2161,and i am reading your comment with Tom Petty s songs playing  Absolutely smiling rn  Please universe if this is a sign then what is it for 
2162,Any consequences that have come about with your decision 
2163,What did the sign say 
2164,"the universe was like  aint nobody hanging on those trees  unless its a swing  
im glad you didn t do it tho  i hope you re doing better now ❤"
2165,Whoa  That freaked me out in a good way 
2166,Whoa  I m glad you saw that truck ❤️
2167,Wow  This one is my favorite so far  I hope you re doing better   
2168,Whoa  What a rollercoaster 
2169,I m sorry but this is absolutely hilarious  I do hope you reconcile with the universe 
2170,See  I would have taken that as a sign to move on past her  just as you were passing by the sign 
2171,With 343 000 people dead worldwide  I d just like to say on behalf of all of us  PLEASE don t ask for any more signs because this is some real monkey s paw shit right here 
2172,I would be ok with staying home every April from now on 
2173,Now ask universe to end this pandemic with people learning the lesson correcting their behaviour to certain extent 
2174,"This reminds me of my story with my mother 


I am not a religious person at all  But my mother was very sick in the hospital  Her birthday was the next day  and I was planning on seeing her that day for a visit in the hospital  I decided to pray  that she made it to her birthday just so I can see her and that she could have one last birthday  I went to see her  Sadly she wasn t awake from all the medication  but I spoke to her for a while and she grabbed and held my hand in her somewhat asleep state 


She passed away around 1AM  an hour after her birthday had ended "
2175,Ah yes  the healthy alternative to tea  Monster energy
2176,Sounds to me like your baby is going to be your new genuine friend    what a fun story to tell them when they get older that you were looking for a friend and one was already a part of you

2180,"God to Birdy  What color do you wanna be 

Birdy   Yes "
2181,HAHAHAH   That would have been a sign too  I guess
2182,Yes  when the astonishment wore off I thought the same thing  and noticed the band on its leg   So I called animal control and they sent a guy out to find the bird  figure out where it belonged  etc  I called the next day and it was safely back at its home  so all worked out well  Way too many dogs and raccoons and such in the East Bay to leave it on its own   
2183,Yes  exactly    I got a bird for ya  How s that for a bird  
2184,Thanks  I m sorry for yours too  Life really can get rough sometimes  I think the death of a parent is especially tough because    I guess the closest I can get to expressing it is this  you wake up the day after your parent died  and the entire world has been replaced by an exact replica except your parent is dead  Exactly the same but also completely different  And nobody even notices how much it s changed  Except you  Anyway  hugs from a stranger  and thanks for reaching out to say you understand   because that really helps

2188,Sadly he died 
2189,"Nice  That s a good hitchhiking story  It can be dangerous too though  I don t recommend for just anybody 
I gave a guy a ride in the city once  It was after midnight  He had me drop him off in an rural area I didn t know  so he ends up directing me to a closed down grocery store in the middle of nowhere  No houses anywhere within site this place  I pulled into a gas station directly in front of the grocery store  The gas station was closed but I knew they had cameras rolling all the time  and it was lit like daytime  He was insisting that I drop him off behind it  Even tried to bribe me with some CDs and crap he had  said we could hang out for a bit  

Now look maybe this guy just lonely and wanted company  Maybe he didn t want to walk from the gas station  Maybe he wanted to do something crazy  I don t know but the environment had me very uneasy and I followed my gut on that one  The more insistent he got about me driving around the back of the grocery store  the more insistent I became that I wasn t going to and the ride was over right here  And nothing really came of it  He hopped out and thanked me for the ride  Scared the hell out of me "
2190,Acid  I went through a couple years where I was so spun out  it s a wonder I climbed out of that rabbit hole  I was constantly doing shit that I thought  If I just do it  and try hard  the universe and the acid magic and all the hippie energy will save me and blah blah   I guess in a way I was right  because the universe did in fact save me on this one  I had a tent with me anyway so I figured if I needed I could walk all day and pitch a tent on the side of the highway at night    And just keep that up for three or four days 
2191,Be pretty fucking mad if he didn t in fairness 
2192,My dude s high school BFFs  now in their 30s  includes a guy who is lovely but just doesn t do the social  leaves the house only to work  spends all his waking hours playing video games  doesn t really get chit chat or small talk  He s now married  His wife was a member of his raiding party and after months of chatting they realized they were both in FL  A while later they decided to meet up  and her gaming PC is now next to his  in the same bedroom he s had since high school 
2193,I have 4 brothers across 3 timezones and 2 countries   We all grew up playing video games and still do 
2194,Yep  my brother lives a few states away but we were still able to hang out every weekend playing video games  even if it is Farming Simulator  He recently got deployed to South Korea  but we re still able to play
2195,It s weird  But I lost my grandpa two days ago and I got online to distract myself because I can t sleep  And my friends got online  I played horrible and didn t talk  But you could tell how supportive they tried being

 Also a somewhat similar situation is how I got to spend 5 years of my childhood in a literal fucking mansion in the Swedish countryside  It wasn t rent  free   but pretty damn close   my parents paid about what a small apartment would ve cost in the city  "

2213,"I make a fuckload of money off of it  They re all so kind because they don t demand underpaying for art  Often I get offered more because they believe I am underselling  They re all good people 

EDIT  I ve got a lot of responses to this which isn t surprising lol  It s kind of a weird thing  you know  But here s some information about what I do 

I mostly draw reference sheets  posed characters  icons  badges  things like that  I very rarely get requests for porn  I believe most of the furry community isn t interested in porn  and especially not fetish porn  but those are the things you see at the surface because they re so outlandish 

I make about  50  100 for a commission  I m actually not very popular at all in the community  I have no traditional schooling  past highschool art classes   all of my art is self taught so I m not great at shading and lighting  but some people are into my drawings so I m happy with that  A lot of the appeal of creating furry art comes from the fact that the characters are so creative and colorful and very fun to draw  and they mean so much to their owners and it makes creating art very satisfying 

I myself don t identify as a furry  but I have a fursona I made based off the animals I like and the colors I like  The thing is I don t really  identify  with her  which is why I don t consider myself a furry  but everyone s identity is different  

Sorry for the long edit  Thought that might clear some stuff up   "
2214,Yeah people like to shit on furries and be toxic to them  but if your a furry artist you can make some serious money

I cannot remember the context of how this came up  but he told me  completely seriously  that reindeer are not real

One night I was walking out to eat some supper on my own when a little old Chinese lady came up to me and told me I was beautiful  elegant  special  and that I was with the wrong person  I should hold out because I belonged with a better man  someone who would treat me properly  She was so sweet and apologised for being so abrupt as to approach me  She also wasn t trying to set me up with her son etc  or sell me anything  She really made my evening  I did end up breaking up with my ex  this happened last year  "

The other on the flip side was when four burly ass dudes picked me up and were speaking a very different accent  I hopped in wondering if these were to be my last days and they took me to the train station I was heading to and waited there with me until my train came  I still have one of them on Facebook "

I took the lid off and was holding a handful of what I later learned is a miserable way to go 

At that moment  my boyfriend knocked on the bathroom door and said that our friend had killed himself 

I saw my friend earlier that day  He just seemed a little moody  like he was tired  He was someone that could make you laugh in a millisecond just passing him in the hall  Smart as all hell  Had the world on a string and such a bright future ahead of him  Nobody saw that plot twist coming  You can never truly get into someone else s head  

It s crazy how one minute changed so many lives  

I can t say I ve done anything that marvelous with my existence  and fuck  can life be hard  But there are small moments every single day that bring me joy  Most of them involve my cats  but alas  I am here because someone else isn t  and I don t take that for granted  I also have seen people torn apart by the loss of a loved one  It is an explosion of grief that causes many aftershocks that never ever stop "

I turned into my street where my house was  you could see it from the main road easily as it was only about 10 houses into it  I decided to look in my rear view mirror and watched as the car stopped in the middle of the main road and just looked down my street   watching me drive   I would have been home alone that night

I don t know the perfect comparison but I like the idea that our conscious mind can process about 7 items of information at a time  very rough idea  but based on the idea that we can hold 7 seperate forms of info in our short term memory  it s the number of seperate numbers or names that the average person can remember at one time   That s 7 pieces of info we can relate to and rearrange to make meaning  The mind that does not form conscious words has no such constraints  It can link a wide diverse amount of info that you re not even aware of  But it has no words to share those links with your conscious mind  It can only really  communicate  through feelings and visions as in dreams  interestingly Nikola Tesla would get visions showing him what would turn out into his best ideas inventors  it wasn t magic  just a way to access a higher calculator than the one he was typically using   That s why visualization exercises can be so powerful  it s a way to communicate with your unconscious what you want in your life and it  magically  uses it s links to make it happen  And for me  if I have a dream that seems very meaningful  not just in the content but also in the feeling it s left with me  it can really help clear up some things or build better understanding of something that happened or something I need to do  Sitting with a feeling too  brings me an insight that I ve been forgetting about  something I ve been avoiding doing or whatever  and almost energises the action itself when the emotion is held in awareness rather than ran away from

After 3 months I won season tickets for one season and 250 bucks to spend at the game after never having spent more than say 25 bucks on lotto tickets in the whole  3 months  Totally worth it  Also maryland didnt tell me I had won no announcements  no email  It was the lottery junkie who checked the website and saw my name and alerted me to claim it "
2425,It s more frequent with more complicated games  The more confusing a scratch card is the more likely it is someone will misinterpret a winning ticket for a losing one and toss it  I once found a  10 winner because whoever had bought it originally hadn t worked out that 23 was larger than 22 
2426,There s a guy with a gambling problem who buys lottery tickets at the store near me  He buys about  50 worth at a time  but he doesn t scratch them all off just the barcode and scans them and leaves them at the nearby bus stop  I thought he was such a prick for leaving losing tickets  but it turns out he often leaves anything under  5 for people to find

Back in college  people would play a song on the radio  and I could figure it out in mere seconds on a piano or guitar

It s cool but ultimately a finished piece can take me anywhere from 6 hours to 3 days and that s a pretty significant time investment when I work full time now  and doodles are just that   doodles  So yup  pretty useless "

1  I can divide almost any number by 2  3  or 4 in a very short time with a great deal of accuracy  When I was a waiter  for the year or so after the credit card machines went mobile  it was commonplace to bring the cheque  and the machine  and THEN find out how they wanted to handle the bill  So I got really good at grabbing three or four cards in hand and doing the math right there in real time 
2  I can flip almost any oblong object really fast and catch it after X revolutions  So I can flip  say  a knife  really really fast and then grab it by the handle  I can t juggle  I ve tried   but if I COULD juggle  I could very easily juggle knives or flaming torches

4  I am really  really good at making up songs on the spot  that scan and rhyme and mostly make sense and are often at least a little clever  In another life I would have been a killer marketing jingle guy or an awesome rapper  This is not a completely useless talent  as this random habit is very entertaining and me and my son and wife spend a lot of time singing very silly songs  and then critiquing how good the song was  and then maybe singing a song about how much the song sucked   but it s not something I can put on a resume 
5  I have a very in depth command of Post War Japanese cinema  Which  really  no one could possibly care less about  Maybe you can get someone to watch  Seven Samurai  if you re lucky  but that s about it

Can t do much with my fingers anymore  but until I was around 13  I could press my right index finger all the way back to touch the back of that hand  That one really freaked people out  and other kids at school would stop me in the hallways all the time just to ask to see it  I had to stop showing people after I switched schools cuz it got annoying  and not doing it for years is probably why I can t anymore "

I d also check out Geography Now  Pretty cool YouTube channel that goes into an in depth explanation of all countries alphabetical  current they re on São Tomé and Principe  and is a useful tool if you want to learn the culture and actual things about the countries  

I d also recommend breaking them up into regions  and I don t mean continents  For example  break the Asian Countries up into Southeast Asia  the Caucus Region  the Arabian Peninsula  Central Asia  The Stans   etc  and break Europe up into Western Europe  Scandinavia  the Balkans  The Baltic Nations  etc  This will help you remember the countries quicker  since you ll only have to memorize at most 5 15 for each region instead of 30 50 "

2902,"Here are a couple tips I ve found really help 

  Many words can often be rearranged to spell other words with the same letters  For example  if you see  eat   it s very likely you can also make  ate    tea   and  eta   

  Looking for suffixes that can tag onto existing words  like   ed     ic   or   ing   If you re feeling particularly saucy  stuff like   ish     tion   or   ally  also works 

  Prefixes are also good   Pro     anti     re     en    and others have served me well 

  This one works especially well if you re playing on a mobile device  just try stuff  They ll tell you whether or not your word is a word  I generally go for smaller words because if I m wrong I didn t waste a lot of time  I also attach different prefixes to the suffixes previously mentioned  or try to connect a prefix to an already made word "

3342,"oh so cake that is mildly chocolate and has red food coloring and a cream cheese frosting    You can also have chocolate cake with cream cheese frosting and it will be basically the same 

I say this sardonically because I have a younger sister who I love to tease about this    But in reality I love it when she enjoys her red velvet cupcakes and I hope you do the same "
3343,I never heard of red velvet cake until I met my wife   her whole family has them for each birthday as a tradition started by her grandmother   It s an unusual recipe from some really old cookbook  not the  standard  with cream cheese frosting   Pretty good  but a pain in the ass to make  and uses an obscene amount of red good coloring

3377,The best carrot cake has a nice tart cream cheese frosting  The one I make basically has a thin layer of lemon cheesecake on top and it s gooooooood 
3378,Try crusting the icing with either shaved pecans or coconut  Tones down on the sweetness and adds a bit of crunch 
3379,Another like me   Growing up  my parents always got me an ice cream cake on my birthday  since my grandma didn t eat eggs   As a result  I hardly ever got to eat actual cake   As an adult  I started insisting on getting cake 
3380,Also it has to be made by a Mexican lady who sells cakes from her house with that amazing frosting that only they make  I don t even know what s in it so I can never find a recipe to make it myself  But it s very fluffy and not too sweet 
3381,I try  but it comes out closer to sour cardboard

3408,TIL 
3409,The fudge with the little chocolate crunchies    mmmmm I m drooling now 
3410,The cake itself sounds awesome  but seriously that name is not good  It only brings to mind two things you never want to associate with cake  taking a dump  or a garbage dump  They couldn t call it quick cake  or easy cake  or minute cake  or blender cake  or drop cake  or combo cake  or literally anything that doesn t make you think of poop 
3411,I would eat that
3412,I think there is a recipe for that
3413,Ok someone went to far 
3414,Go easy on him  he probably just hasn t had a proper pie crust  Some pie crusts are just soggy and sad 
3415,I think you mean all three of them lol
3416,non

3418,It s not really a problem if you don t have a subconscious obsession with poop 
3419,Then put that in a pie

  Procreation  

For some reason this was the number 1 priority from our feedback groups by a wide margin  We expected your multiplication rate to be higher given the overuse of this feature   

  Made pregnancy a more controllable process  Some people were having trouble procreating whereas many more were unintendedly starting the process  prematurely   While many factors still come into play  age  sex  lifestyle and genetic fertility mainly   the luck factor has been significantly decreased  Sorry for all you folks who maxed out the luck attribute   
  Increased size of the female clitoris  It was always meant to be a fun puzzle for the partner  but apparently even some females were having trouble finding their own and that obviously was never intended 
  Every male receives a 10  increase in penis length and girth  The thing was functioning perfectly fine and completely as intended yet the males kept complaining and feeling insufficient so there  We listened  Now stop complaining 
  Lowered the standard deviation on penile length  There were always meant to be some variance but apparently it was too high  making the men near the mean  the vast majority  way too insecure 
  Lowered the standard deviation on breast size  Same reason as above but now applying to females 
  Replaced the turkey neck skin on men s ballsack with human skin  To be honest  this was just an oversight from our development crunch  Was always meant to be proper skin  Sorry 
  Moved the male prostate to just below the perineum for ease of access  Interestingly  this was mainly requested by straight men 
  Gave humans of both sexes more control over their anus  We never intended the waste disposal system to be used in this fashion but since you people kept doing it   
  The testicles  vagina and penis have increased durability and less pain receptors  We figured we had done enough to protect these areas but you people   are fucking stupid   inventive 
  Have decreased transmission and morbidity rates for all veneral diseases  You re welcome 
  Have introduced a new veneral disease called  exploding genital syndrome   It s triggered when attempting to engage in sexual intercourse with other species and humans that have not yet developed secondary sex characteristics  Take a hint you fucking pervs  you know who you are 


  Intelligence and psyche  

  Have decreased the aggression tendency because sweet Jesus  what the fuck 
  Have increased historical memory and learning ability  You re supposed to learn from previous mistakes  not repeat them  evolution and all that  
  Fixed a bug where a lot of people had broken morality code  There will always be a few without just to keep things interesting  but the percentage of people who had it disabled was way too high  Morality code will still be based on culture  upbringing  nurture  etc  
  Have significantly lowered the amount of people with mental diseases  The percentages were way off 
  The intelligence distribution system was way out of whack  It was supposed to be a standard deviation type of graph  not a negative non linear relationship 


  Other  

  Have made the weight gain loss system more predictable  The system still functions more or less the same  it s just that we ve given everyone the same genetics so you no longer have to guess which system will work for you 
  All humans now genetically know how to swim  How did you guys not have this  We implemented this for just about every other species  Couldn t you fuckers have picked it up somewhere along the line  
  Decreased sugar cravings for all humans  It s a solid system from an evolutionary point of view but since you guys have learned to grow food all year around  the high sugar cravings were no longer necessary "

The city closest to Alabama would be Dordrecht 

The government gave Dupont permission to build a chemical plant there so you know the worth our govt places on the people living there  

And the general Dutch opinion of this town is pretty much summed up by the nation wide saying about this town 

 Hoe dichter bij Dordt  hoe rotter het word   this translates to   the closer to dordrecht you ve trodden  more things became rotten    works better as a rhyme in my language 

When we moved there the priest from the church across the road came to visit to see if we were living in sin or not 

I asked him if he was the leader of the Congolese congregation that always showed up dressed to the nines in outlandishly flamboyant styles  

He replied   The blackies  O nonono  They just use my building sometimes  

When we went to bars to find some new friends and struck up conversation most people would remark   you re not from around here are you   followed by stone walling  At first I thought it was a defense mechanism against the busloads of tourists that came to the city every day the old kingdoms became a united country in this city and government held office there  So I started convo s by saying we just moved into a house in the centre and if people had some tips etc  And still they said the same until an old ladt pulled me aside and just flat out told me that these people would never accept outsiders and she d been facing exclusion for 12 years  

Also  maaany fights outside my house  Random people screaming in the streets  Rampant rascism by store personell  Never seen people behave so badly in my life  

My car got keyed 7 times  Nails in my tires  Car got broken into  The landlord was a complete bitch that wanted us to pay part of the roof repairs after a storm  I went to the doctor to see about a growth I had and he described a salve  back in my home town the doctor took one look turned and said it s the type of cancer that the dupont chemicals cause  

There were shootings every week  police helicopter circling was a daily thing and one street was permanently cordonned off by the police because it was too dangerous there   all very  very unique in my country where police officers reach the national news when they pull their weapon without discharging

They have a thing called carnaval  which for some reason is in the winter  fun fact  the Dutch coronavirus patient zero attended carnaval  all of Brabant was fucked   This is a full week of dressing up  parades  partying and alcohol  Leading up to carnaval of course there are pre parties to gear up and strengthen the liver 

It is normal to start drinking when you re 13 or so in Brabant  The adults are celebrating carnaval and getting hammered  let the kids chill out with their friends 

They talk in a distinctly different accent  they have a soft g  while up north I sound like I m choking on phlegm when I pronounce a g   

They love their farmers  The farmers took their tractors to The Hague and ran down the front door of a government building  ran down a fence nearly killing a cyclist and causing major traffic  I don t know if those people were from Brabant but I m lumping them in  

Brabant is the place to be to make drugs  If you re taking xtc in Europe chances are it was produced in Brabant  Barrels of chemical waist are regularly dumped in fields  I read they are making the switch to crystal meth 

I m sure other people can think of a lot more whacky Brabant things  I d love to hear them "

Friesland is populated mostly by farmers and cows  I m led to believe that all my milk comes from there  During new years day they fill big metal milk jugs with some explosive compound and put a ball on top of it  Then they light it and the ball goes flying off into the farmland  it s called karbietschieten 

Sometime at the start of a new year they collect old Christmas trees and nowadays any tree they can find  These are made into a mountain  honestly they are huge  the highest point you will find in our flat land  and light them on fire  They have a competition to see who can make the biggest one  measured in volume  I think this is called vreugdevuur 

Finally there is a jest going on between Friesland and the rest of the Netherlands  They see us as  city people  and we see them as  bunch of farmers   This has really gotten out of hand lately  people are pretty salty both ways  It has led to some good memes though "

4169,Especially southern Alberta  Fucking Taber 
4170,This isn t the first time I ve seen this on Reddit recently  In fact the video of the persons dressed as a Storm Trooper was in Alberta and someone said they thought it was the southern US and someone else said   It s Alberta  so close enough    What makes Alberta so unique that it mimics our southern states

4224,Birmingham isn t great but Norfolk is definitely the Alabama
4225,Mississipi is the most impoverished state but it doesn t have the same tongue in cheek reputation Alabama does for incestuous relations for some reason  Being super poor and racist doesn t serve the same internet friendly fun as as cousin sibling shenanigans  Alabama also enacted that abortion ban that made headlines in the news last year  which did not help their reputation any   No way to get rid of those inbred pregnancies  
4226,I d say by reputation alone it s West Virginia tbh  I mean  Alabama for incest and poverty  Florida for crazy people and retirees  and California for crazy people and liberalism  but West Virginia just    doesn t really have a lot going for it   Other than the gorgeous  nature  obviously  but it s not the sort that s easily turned into money or opportunities

4239,It s a stereotype  which are usually fun  and  importantly  unlike some other stereotypes  it s not really hurting anybody  Alabamans are generally held back by poverty and such as a result of environment and the states  economic situation  which maybe makes it meanspirited  but as far as I m aware there s no actual pattern of discrimination against Alabamans or the South specifically

4288,Lived in lloydminster for two years  I loathed it  However Edmonton and Calgary  and jasper  and Banff were great 
4289,Then there s the special place of Cardston   
4290,Conservative politics  People make it out to be religious  but it s not at all  Some religious quacks here and there but more focused on being fiscally conservative  People think it s racist too  but they ve never been to Calgary and seen that it s like 30  poc  Our population went from 300k in 1970 to 1 1M now so most people are from somewhere else  foreign or other parts of Canada  People love to post pictures of Banff then proceed to shit on us  Oil and farming  and the general western gun ownership views and country style is why people associate that with Alberta

Splitting of the HRE by the grandsons of Charlamagne  There were 3 kingdoms created  and if you look up the borders of lotharingia you will see what a fucking garbage mess it was  Formed the basis of franco germanic rivalries for the next millennia  The borders of lotharingia beyond the alps was contested between the new HRE and france because there was never any clear owner  and the ages and ages of bad blood from arguing started right there  when the land went to a 3rd party in the most undefendable borders possible 

The 4th crusade s detour  The 4th crusade was hot garbage  detouring to constantinople to help a deposed emperor get back the byzantine emperor through a venician middle man to the crusaders  Turns out the emperor who deposed him left the royal coffers dry so the city was fucking decimated by pillaging crusaders 

To go down how consequential this was  Constantinople was the lynchpin of the byzantines  Losing it gave the ottomans the leverage to  help  the byz get their land back  which the ottomans obviously didnt give back after  helping  them   This meant the ottomans could take over the balkans and turkey  becoming the super power they did  THIS then forced europe to look for new chinese trade routes to keep from paying trade tax to a muslim nation  This caused a push for an eastern route search which gave rise to deep water traversal technology which caused european colonialism 

TLDR  that  the 4th crusade in the 1200s caused european colonialism to happen early  possibly at all  though that is less concrete  

The adoption of roman christianity was done by a single battle  The emperor had a dream where god told him to paint the initials of jesus on his army s shields and if he did he d win the next battle  He did  and he won  There was a lot more nuiance that I wont get into  but this was the tipping point that caused christianity to be formally adopted as the roman faith  which caused literally anything church related in europe 

The choice for khwarezmia to insult genghis khan  Insult is a light word  try murdering his diplomats and force GK s hand when he was trying to move past raiding  rading the middle east at least   This is around modern day persia  turkey  and the  stan countries  The mongols  fucking erased  Khwarezmia off the map and took over the land  This caused the mongols to push into modern day turkey which caused a gisnt power vacuum on the collapse of GK s ancestor s empires which then caused a scramble for power of which the Ottomans came out of    you get the picture on what the ottomans caused 

People mentiom technology like the printing press and such  but what caused europe to become this hotbed of new age breadbaskets  colonialists  etc is so much more important  It s what lead to these creations in the first place  what caused their adoption  and what helped them spread as europe was the continent of nations  These are but 3 examples of the butterfly effect in action "

There are things that if they didn t happen the way they would have  would likely have come to be a different way  For example  if not Gutenberg  someone would have invented the printing press  If fire hadn t been discovered however it was discovered  it would have eventually been discovered another way  If the Code of Hammurabi wouldn t have been the first conceptualization of written law  something else would have been  If the Norse hadn t discovered North America  Columbus would have 

Then  there are things that almost certainly would not have happened if they hadn t happened the way they did  Examples would be the death of Ferdinand  the crucifixion of Jesus Christ  or  if you don t believe in it  the work of Paul to popularize of the story of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ   the unification of China  arguably   Genghis Kahn s empire  etc 

If we re talking about things of the first type  I d say agriculture 

If we re talking about things of the second type  I d say either Alexander the Great s Empire  which would not have happened without him  or what Paul did to plant the seeds of Christianity  which whether you consider it good  bad  true  false  whatever  it is without question that so many of the other examples provided here  WWI  WWII  the proliferation of printed communication  etc   were either fueled by or built upon the lattice of Christianity or beliefs and institutions created in the service of it "

4645,"Have you read Sapiens  He argues that was not only the most important but also the worst thing we ever did  We went from hunter gatherers with varied diets  close knit social circles and generally interesting lives to grinding  back breaking monotonous work which yielded a limited and unhealthy diet and the increase in population caused disease and the break down of the social circles 

Obviously it wasn t really a  moment  that people decided to become farmers but thousands of years of gradual change eventually took us there "
4646,Yea  That is the single most important event  Other than   of course  existing
4647,aka The Agricultural Revolution  Check out Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari  He covers the 4 major revolutions of humanity   Cognitive  Agricultural  Unification and Scientific  Great read 
4648,I m going to be that guy and point out that OP asked for single events  Agriculture was invented many times by various people groups and it was a very gradual process 
4649,I m not sure I d call something that took thousands of years via a huge number of steps a  single event  
4650,Not a really good example for this thread  That happened numerous times throughout many regions of the world and that s without them even spreading that information to each other  Agriculture was going to happen and be embraced by humanity

4659,See that s actually really cool  One theory is when they were hunter gatherers  the women would often take certain plants and plant them  Then by the time the group came around to the same area a while later  they returned to grown crops  Eventually they copped on that the best looking crops replanted will repeat the process so it was a selective thing too

4693,Everything about Rome in general has so much impact on world history  Romance Latin languages and cultures  Justinian Law  Christian Schisms  Even the Renaissance  Every European emperor who named their seats after Caesar or saw themselves as an heir of the Roman Byzantine continuum and legacy 
4694,"Everyone keeps saying things that were inevitable like Franz Ferdinand getting shot or the invention of the printing press but the world was going to go to war one way or another in 1914 and some time of printing press would have been invented at some point 

I am going to go with Rome not surrendering to Hannibal after the battle of Cannae  After getting their ass thoroughly kicked at Lake Tresimene and Trebia river  they took somewhere between 60 000 80 000 in losses including both consuls  With a completely devastated army  they elected to just fight all along the Italian peninsula but avoid Hannibal Barca and let him have his way wherever they went  The Second Punic War continued for SIXTEEN YEARS after Cannae but the strategy worked and eventually decisive victories in Iberia and Italy against generals who weren t Hannibal led to Scipio marching on Carthage  Hannibal was recalled to Africa and lost to Scipio at the Battle of Zama  The Romans beat the Carthaginians and would destroy Carthage five decades later 

If the Romans had surrendered after Cannae like every other civilization in the history of time would have done  the world would like completely different  There would have been no Roman Republic after the second century BC  no Julius Caesar  no Pax Romana  Jesus would have been born in a Parthian or Selucid providence  no Roman Empire  no Holy Roman Empire  no Byzantine Empire  and the list goes on and on 

Who knows what the world would look like if the Romans hadn t told Hannibal to kick rocks  One thing is for certain  it would have look a fuckton different than it does today "

  On 18 August  OKH submitted a strategic survey  Denkschrift  to Hitler regarding the continuation of operations in the East  The paper made the case for the drive to Moscow  arguing once again that Army Groups North and South were strong enough to accomplish their objectives without any assistance from Army Group Center  It pointed out that there was enough time left before winter to conduct only a single decisive operation against Moscow   

  On 20 August  Hitler rejected the proposal based on the idea that the most important objective was to deprive the Soviets of their industrial areas

At the airport the directer and producer cornered her and said they didnt have any good footage and that she needed to start a fight with her best friend  The girl broke down in tears and did not do it  The whole time the directer and producer were beating down on her  Saying she had to do it  its what they paid her for  This girl thought she was getting a chance of a lifetime  Ooph I can still hear her crying  I dont even think the show ever aired "

4738,"Well the thing that gets me is that now anyone can create information are people tend to seek information that validates their own viewpoint 

It creates a cycle where people believe in information that has no basis 

Press printing press allowed spreading information a limited number of people had access to the printing press to create information

4741,Steve  Lol  do you really think his name was Steve 
4742,I m not sure  The big think about print was that it access to useful information that most people had never had before  The internet lets you get lots of useless information  but other than being a bit quicker to find  I m not sure it gives access to new information  What it does allow is better organization  in the same way printed flyers and books did  but I think its overall impact is smaller 
4743,I assume that s what they meant  Prior printing presses weren t all that useful 
4744,Not positive  but maybe because an elevator is necessary for buildings over 10 stories to be practical
4745,I guess both of these ideas can be filed under the invention of agriculture itself  Once we had that nailed down we had more time to sit around and figure out better ways of creating tools and communicating with each other more 
4746,I feel like this a stupid question  but  are there wild cows 
4747,Yeah  but we stopped starving in bad weather  which I assume was the point

4753,Good point  It s hard to characterize it as  agriculture  when Krug took a shit with seeds in it 15 000 years ago and a plant popped up later 
4754,The plague definitely did reduce the workforce substantially  but it also showed the peasants that their kings weren t protected by a god  This realization opened the door for the latter half of the Renaissance and began the motions toward what we know as a state  But  it took until 1648 and the signing of the Treaty of Westphalia for our modern democracy to begin it s rapid ascension  Although I do believe the Black Plague was one of the most changing events in human history  I m not sure how much I can subscribe to the idea that democracy wouldn t have formed  In my years of studying political science  I believe that people were always going to form some sort of democracy esque society  The idea of democracy and republics date back to the Athenians and I d like to believe it would ve came about no matter what 
4755,Coalesced enough  specifically speaking of the fever pitch of the period between 1347   1351 in which 1 3 of Europeans were killed

4760,Same is true for the printing press  honestly  Somebody else would just have done it 
4761,But it wasn t solely responsible  so it wouldn t really change much if it never happened  WWI would ve absolutely still happened and outside of some weird butterfly effect type shit  everything else would ve too 
4762,WWI was going to happen regardless of whether or not the Archduke was killed  If that hadn t happened some other event would have that would have caused tensions to spill over 
4763,No WW1  no WW2  no Russian Revolution  or the Reds would not have won the ensuing civil war  no Roaring 20s  no Great Depression  no penicillin  who knows what other meds were never invented due to millions of  educated people being murdered in the camps   USA not a world power  No freeway system  Possibly no space program  Yeah  going with this one 
4764,The whole thing probably is one of the biggest ripple effects of modern history  Without it we wouldn t have had WWI  roaring 20 s and Great Depression  WW2  the Holocaust  Russian Revolution  or USA becoming a world power  Heck  the Cold War and space race might ve not happened 
4765,"It wasn t really that random that they ran into each other  Princip waited at a point on the originally planned route  and Ferdinand s driver accidentally took a turn down the originally planned route  instead of following the new plan

4787,If Hitler wasn t a megalomaniac he would ve never attempted half of the things he did 
4788,"Yes   

World War 1 has to be understood in context   The assassination of the Arch Duke was the excuse Germany had been looking for   But that s all he was  an excuse   And a substitute able one at that 

Arch Duke Ferdinand wasn t that important of a figure during his life   Any excuse would have done for Germany  a riot  a coup  some other blue blood getting shot  anything   The Balkans was a powder keg during the early years of the 20th century and Germany was itching for an excuse to flex its newly industrialized muscle 

The assassination was the most immediate cause of the war but if Princip had forgotten to buy bullets for his gun  the war would have started in another week  another month  or another year   His assassination is not THAT important because it could have been swapped out for a hundred other events that would have produced exactly the same outcome "

We don t actually know anything about that time period so its basically just theory but in the book he theorises that agriculture became a trap  People eventually started growing their own crops rather than just eating from wild growth   presumably because they felt it would be easier  Then they had to till the field  and have more children so they could mind the crop and cover the land theyve planted  Then the fact they ve had children means they need to feed them which takes away the extra food to farm was meant to provide  Then you need to defend the crop from other people so you needs guards etc etc etc until eventually we became stationary and unhealthier

4820,Seriously    Europe was ready to start a war  it just need someone to pull the trigger  If it wasn t Ferdinands assassination  it would have simply been something else 
4821,And accordingly  Hitler likely would have never rose to power since Germany wouldn t have been in the terrible economic position enforced by the WW1 treaty 
4822,And to build on this without WW2 and the Russian revolution  there would be no cold war  The cold war led to the arming of the Taliban in Afganistan as well as US intervention in Middle East  which lead to a significant amount of decisions that the US has made in both foreign and domestic policy 
4823,Yep   The US pre WWI isolation policy becomes more and more ingrained as the years go on without WWI
4824,"Doesn t this assume only positive outcomes in a vacuum though  If WW1 didn t happen  what s stopping tensions from escalating into an alternative war  

I m of the opinion that stability is almost a  finite resource  that ebbs and flows in history regardless of choices made "
4825,Nah  Europe was a powder keg surrounded by flame  it was only a matter of time  especially with all the treaties and such those in power wanted a war  If it wasn t Ferdinand it would have been something else to kick it off  Hell Austria Hungary s demands were out of this world and anyone with half a brain knew there was no way in hell they would even remotely agree to their demands 
4826,If it meant the Russian revolution and Cold War never happens  then by extent 9 11 and the war on terror doesn t happen  The US funded Islamic groups to fight back the Soviets  and when they won they turned on the US  Really  the Middle East itself would be better off since it wouldn t have been split up into various different countries  there would be no need to form Israel out of Palestine  and it wouldn t become a target for Russia and the USA

At one point  the middle east had decent leaders and were rapidly becoming more modernized  They had buildings  instructure coming alone on par with others  people were treated decently  Women weren t forced to cover every inch of themselves  

But  their stabilization meant they were gaining more and more power and say over what happened to the oil from their land and demanded to be properly compensated  So  naturally  it was decided the best approach would be to kill their leaders  bomb everything we could  and supply arms to the radicals  Then deny it all and paint hatred of western countries as just hate filled terrorism

4867," Did the Earth move off its orbit around the sun 

Maybe slightly but I m certain this event is what gave the Earth it s current Axis it rotates on 

 Why did it stop moving if there wasn t any friction in space

Why did what stop moving  The Earth  It never did  it got hit pretty badly but nothing bad enough to push it out of its orbit or stop it moving completely 

 What were the mechanical kinetic     consequences on the earth s motion after the strike 

Well  besides being tilted on it s Axis by the impact  The Earth was temporarily turned into a sea of molten rock and accrued a huge accretion disk which eventually coalesced and became the Moon "
4868,"  It s a straight line 

It s not  though   If you can take any given event and substitute it for something else and get the same outcome  then the event isn t that important 

If we substitute a riot in Zegreb for the assassination in Sarajevo we still get WW1 nearly exactly as it happened   Contrast that with the events of 9 11   If we swap out the planes flying into buildings with truck bombs or a mass shooting or attacks on embassies  by al Qaeda  those won t lead to a war in Afghanistan or the Iraq war
